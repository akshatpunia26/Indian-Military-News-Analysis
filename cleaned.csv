During their recent Earnings Call for Q4FY23, top management officials of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) announced that the designs for all parts of the LCA Mark-2 are nearly completed, and the company is gearing up to initiate production of the prototype. The HAL expressed confidence that the LCA Mark-2, equipped with more powerful engines and numerous upgrades compared to the existing Tejas, will be developed as per schedule, with its maiden flight anticipated in mid-2025. The LCA Mark-2, also known as Tejas Mark-2, holds immense strategic importance for the Indian Air Force (IAF) as it aims to address the impending shortage of fighter squadrons caused by the gradual retirement of Jaguars, MiG-29s, and Mirage 2000s over the next decade. The LCA Mark-2, along with the indigenous Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), will be positioned as a suitable replacement for these ageing aircraft, ensuring the IAF’s operational capabilities remain robust. The LCA Mark-2 and AMCA are part of India’s strategic vision to bolster its defence capabilities and reduce dependence on imported military equipment. These indigenous fighter aircraft projects represent the country’s determination to establish self-sufficiency in the defence sector and promote domestic manufacturing."
China Solidifies JF-17’s Position in Argentina as Tejas and F-16 Face Setbacks,https://idrw.org/china-solidifies-jf-17s-position-in-argentina-as-tejas-and-f-16-face-setbacks/,"May 23, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. China is making notable progress in solidifying the presence of its JF-17 aircraft in Argentina, while India’s Tejas and the F-16 face obstacles in their market prospects. Against the backdrop of Argentina’s economic challenges, the country is increasingly exploring cost-effective options, which China eagerly offers, including the potential for exporting a dozen JF-17s and enabling local production rights. Previously, the Danish F-16 MLU appeared to be leading the competition among the JF-17, Tejas, and itself for Argentina’s consideration. However, recent reports suggest that the Danish offer might be withdrawn, potentially paving the way for Ukraine to receive F-16s from the Western Block as military aid in their confrontation with Russia. China has presented an assertive proposition, highlighting proven features such as ejection seats that can replace the current UK-manufactured Martin Baker ejection seats deployed on the JF-17. In contrast, India has offered to replace British-origin Line-Replaceable Units (LRUs), ejection seats, and aerial refuelling (AAR) probes with indigenous alternatives. However, India is yet to demonstrate the viability of its replacements, and the time required for such conversions may impact the attractiveness of its offer."

Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann highlighting the gravity of the issue has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for installation of CCTV cameras at strategic locations in the border villages of Punjab to keep a tab on drones and check activities of drug smugglers. Speaking to Indianarrative.com, Special Director General of Police (DGP) Arpit Shukla said that Village Defence Committees (VDCs) will also be set up in border villages to keep an eye on activities of drug smugglers. The Punjab police and BSF have joined hands for better coordinated efforts and senior officials of the two forces held a joint coordination cum review meeting in Amritsar to take stock of the situation. DIG (Border Range) Narinder Bhargav and DIG (Ferozepur Range) Ranjit Singh Dhillon along with four DIGs and four Commandants of BSF were part of the meeting. “Both the forces are working together to counter the drone operations at Punjab borders, which have emerged as the new threat. We need to carry out evidence-based and proactive policing to prevent the smuggling of narcotics and weapons into Punjab from across the border,” said Shukla. The BSF had shot down four Pakistani drones along the International border in Punjab over the week-end as there was a sudden surge in UAV activity. Earlier 11 Pakistani drones had been drones destroyed till April 30 this year to 11. Around 100 incidents of drone intrusions into Indian territory have been reported between Jan- May 22 this year.

A total of 224 spotted drones were fired upon by BSF personnel in 2022 while the number stood at 43 in 2021. The central investigating agencies are probing the link between the four-fold increase in drone activity in 2022 to Khalistani Separatist Amritpal Singh who also arrived in the state the same year. Highly placed sources reveal that Singh’s links have been traced to cross-border drug dealers based in Pakistan like Billa, Bilal, and Rana. These dealers are pumping drugs into India with the help of local criminals and villagers located closer to the border. The investigations against Amritpal and his aides so far highlights an active role in cross-border smuggling of arms, ammunition, and drugs in close coordination with ISI to destabilise law and order in Punjab. The BSF data highlights that Amritsar, Gurdaspur, and Ferozepur recorded the highest number of drone movements. The area is near Singh’s native village and there are allegations of him brainwashing the local youth into actively participating in the same. According to the BSF records, the Punjab border remained the most active sector for Pakistan’s nefarious activities in 2022 amongst the four states that share the International Border with the hostile neighbour."

"No visible Chinese incursion since 1962, claims Arunachal Pradesh BJP leader",https://idrw.org/no-visible-chinese-incursion-since-1962-claims-arunachal-pradesh-bjp-leader/,"May 22, 2023","SOURCE: IANS There has been no visible incursion or encroachment of land in Arunachal Pradesh by China since 1962, a senior BJP leader in the state has claimed after a tour to the last villages and outposts along the line of actual control (LAC). Arunachal Pradesh shares a disputed 1,129 km border with China’s Tibetan Autonomous Region. The LAC demarcates the disputed border between India and China. BJP’s state vice-president Tarh Tarak had led the ‘Seema Yatra’ (border tour) comprising 10 party leaders. Local party leaders joined in each leg of the tour that started on December 22 from Anjaw sector and ended in Tawang sector on April 24. “During our border tour of more than four months, we interacted with the Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel along the LAC and residents of the border villages. We came to know that the situation on the border is normal and peaceful,” he claimed. “There is no visible encroachment of our state’s land by the Chinese soldiers. But members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army sometimes enter our territory by mistake during long-range patrols along the LAC, which is challenged by our Indian soldiers,” Tarak said, adding that this happens as the border between the two Asian giants is not clearly defined. A senior Army official, however, said cases of low-impact incursions have been reported in the eastern and western parts of Arunachal Pradesh in recent times. “Our soldiers thwarted their attempts,” an Army officer said, seeking anonymity. “We decided to conduct the tour after Indian and Chinese troops clashed along the LAC at Yangtse, in Tawang sector on 09.12.22, which created a hue and cry throughout the country. Our aim was to salute the armed forces guarding the border in harsh conditions and also to physically visit the border outposts and know the ground reality,” Tarak said. He said the tour gave the BJP team an idea about the problems faced by the people living in the border areas and the status of implementation of various central and state Govt schemes. Some soldiers of both countries sustained minor injuries during the December 9 clash in the Tawang sector. Both sides, however, disengaged from the area immediately. A similar incident took place in October 2021 when a large Chinese patrol team was detained for a few hours by the Indian Army near Yangtse. China claims some 90,000 sqkm of Arunachal Pradesh as its territory. It calls the area ‘Zangnan’ in Chinese language and makes repeated references to Arunachal as ‘South Tibet’. Chinese maps show Arunachal Pradesh as part of China, and sometimes refer to it as ‘so-called Arunachal Pradesh’. On April 2, the Chinese Govt released a list of “standardised” names of 11 places in Arunachal Pradesh in Chinese, Tibetan and pinyin characters, acting in accordance with regulations on geographical names issued by the State Council, the equivalent of the Chinese Cabinet."

The personnel have also been asked to avoid presence on social media as this can lead to engagement with strangers and one can be a victim of such enemy intelligence operatives, the officials said. DRDO chief Dr Samir V Kamat has taken a strong view of the incident and has empathised that everyone in the defence research agency must behave and act responsibly while using the internet. The officials said all the personnel have to be responsible enough on social media and other apps as many such operatives have been trying to target individual officers using WhatsApp numbers mostly from outside the country. The DRDO works on strategic projects that are most of the time classified in nature. On May 3, the Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad arrested top DRDO scientist Pradeep Kurulkar on charges of leaking sensitive information to a virtual honey trapper suspected to be a Pakistani intelligence operative. He was allegedly honey-trapped by a woman whom he had befriended on social media last year. The DRDO had carried out a probe into his activities and was prima facie found to be leaking information after which he was sacked as the Director of the lab he was heading in Pune. He was head of the Research and Development Establishment (Engineers) in Pune."

Mushaal had even threatened the G20 nations, stating that if they attend the meetings, they would be seen as siding with the oppressor by accepting PM Modi’s invitation to participate in the event. The agencies have proof regarding this. This report indicates how obsessed Pakistan is to stop India from organising G20 meetings in Kashmir. Additionally, this report has exposed Mushaal as one who is acting at the behest of the Pakistani toolkit. The report says that there are possibilities that Tehreek-e-Kashmir (TeK) UK and Europe might hold protests in major cities of the UK and Europe. TeK UK has been dispatching letters and petitions to all MPs and MEPs in the European nation. “A petition might be submitted at 10 Downing Street, London, the prime minister’s office in this regard to seek the British government’s help to withdraw from the event,” the report read. Indian Intelligence have prepared a list of numbers which are spreading fake information against the G20 meetings in Kashmir. These numbers are being used by Pakistani outfits and their agents in India. Apart from this the agencies have prepared a full list of Facebook pages which have been spreading rumours against India ahead of the G20 meetings.

Pakistani nuclear tests in focus after Baloch diaspora launches protests,https://idrw.org/pakistani-nuclear-tests-in-focus-after-baloch-diaspora-launches-protests/,"May 22, 2023","SOURCE: IANS On May 28 Pakistan will celebrate the ‘Youm-e-Takbir’, the ‘Day of Greatness’ to give itself a pat on its back, for the nuclear tests in 1998, under the shadow of an unprecedented revolt against the powerful army. Around the same time, the Baloch diaspora will protest against the Pakistani nuclear tests in Balochistan as Aasrokh – day of mourning. Pakistan had conducted the tests in utter secrecy in the Chagai district of Balochistan, not even revealing about the tests to the Baloch chief minister and his cabinet who came to know about the tests only through the media. In a press statement, the Free Balochistan Movement (FBM) said that it would hold simultaneous demonstrations in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany to highlight the negative effects of the radiation on the Baloch community. The FBM statement said that after Pakistan’s 1998 nuclear tests in Chagai, “drought and skin cancer and other radiation-induced diseases have become common among people. It has destroyed the ecosystems of the areas which has damaged the agriculture and livestock of our poor people”. The Baloch diaspora plans to hold the protests to lobby with the European nations against the nuclear tests which, it says were conducted against the will of the local community. The tests were carried out by Pakistan in the Ras koh mountain range and Chaagi district of Balochistan on May 28, 1998. The Baloch activists also plan to run a social media campaign with the hashtag #NoToPakistaniNukes on May 28. Pakistan had conducted a total of six nuclear tests between May 28 and May 30, 1998. The country had begun its quest for a nuclear device after India, under then prime minister Indira Gandhi, had tested one in 1974. In response, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who was later hanged to death, said famously: “We will eat grass… but we will make a bomb”. The Baloch have been struggling for an independent Baloch nation soon after the Pakistani Army invaded the independent land in March 1948 and annexed it. At that very moment as the Pakistani Army was marching into Balochistan, its Parliament was debating on how to tackle an imminent Pakistani threat in case of an invasion. Since then, the Baloch tribes, people and various armed groups have been running a lethal struggle against the Pakistani Army and the government for a free nation. The FBM, which advocates for an independent Balochistan, says that it wants an independent investigation by the UN on the impact of these tests on the people and environment of Balochistan. It also wants areas contaminated by radioactivity to be cleaned of toxicity as well as compensation to be paid to the local Baloch community that has suffered from diseases and deformities."
"Army, CPEC activities damage ecology of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir",https://idrw.org/army-cpec-activities-damage-ecology-of-pakistan-occupied-kashmir/,"May 22, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The ecology of the Kashmir occupied by Pakistan (PoK) is being destroyed by an expanding military presence, including insurgent camps and the footprints of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), reported Asian Lite International. According to media reports and expert commentators in Pakistan, the region’s ecology has suffered due to the sharp decline in forest cover. For obvious security concerns, they avoid discussing the military presence and the terrorist camps that are cited with evidence by Western think tanks. On the other side, Pakistani writers call for the army’s “intervention” to stop the clearing of forests and the smuggling of wood by private contractors, claiming a conspiracy between governmental authorities and the “timber mafia,” as per Asian Lite International. The CPEC passes through the Khunjerb Pass in the Gilgit Baltistan region where activity has increased as the Chinese seek more and safer access across the unstable region where their employees and enterprises have been assaulted by terrorists. As a result, Pakistan now has a bigger military presence. Both parties support local commercial interactions. The fragile ecology suffers a net loss. An editorial in Daily Siasat, as cited by Asian Lite International, has expressed concern over the “merciless cutting of timber, smuggling and deforestation in PoK.” “The absence of a forest policy and corruption has made the situation extremely vulnerable,” it warns, adding, “The situation is alarming as it is not only destroying the resources of PoK without any benefit to the state but also extremely harmful to the environment. Alternative fuel sources must be made available in order to put an end to the cutting of trees. The issue required rapid action in order to be resolved, as failure to do so would likely result in a serious environmental catastrophe. The PoK is known as a forestry state, with the Forest Department in charge of 42 per cent of its 13,297 square kilometres (5,134 sq. miles) of land. The PoK has a population of roughly 4.36 million people, 88.12 per cent of whom live in rural areas and rely on agriculture, cattle, and forest resources for a living. Hammad Gilani, wrote in Pakistan Observer, as quoted by Asian Lite International, “A closer look reveals shocking losses, such as the massive deforestation by the timber mafia in the undulating valleys of Pak-occupied Kashmir and the rapid deforestation in dense green areas.” “If this situation continues then forests and trees will soon be cut from Pak-occupied Kashmir. Rain and snowfall will stop in the region, which will end the natural beauty.” Gilani laid the responsibility on the “timber mafia” that cooperates with the government. The political backing of the timber mafia is a significant contributor to deforestation. As a result, the political class is disregarded, and the mafia keeps killing out this great blessing of nature. Thanks to this human assault, this magnificent area is progressively becoming less beautiful over time. As dense woods steadily disappear, the ecology suffers as a result. The folks who live close to the woods have not received gasoline from the government. The primary cause of deforestation is said to be their “unwise approach” of using wood and forests for their everyday necessities. The majority of rural households utilise enormous trees taken from forests to build their homes, ceilings, bridges, furniture, and most critically, fuel, which is the only form of energy they have access to (for cooking and heating). In PoK, a typical home uses three trees for fuel and maintenance purposes including roof repairs. Unrestricted usage of wood is still prevalent in business and residential buildings. In the remainder of the nation, timber is highly valuable commercially. Gilani said that the local population also uses timber products “for cash,” Asian Lite International reported."
Garuda Aerospace and HAL subsidiary Naini Aerospace join hands to manufacture Make in India drones,https://idrw.org/garuda-aerospace-and-hal-subsidiary-naini-aerospace-join-hands-to-manufacture-make-in-india-drones/,"May 22, 2023","SOURCE: UNI Uttar Pradesh-based Naini Aerospace engineering Limited (NAeL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that it will begin drone manufacturing by the end of June this year. The public sector unit has partnered with Chennai-based drone startup, Garuda Aerospace that would help them make advanced precision drones on Indian soil for various applications, especially farming. That said these drones would support farmers by providing cost-effective solutions to increase their productivity by using technology enabled drones and cater to day to day agricultural needs, according to Garuda Aerospace. The drones are designed to be able to carry a payload of around 25 kg and shall cover a radius of 500-metre with speed of 5 metre/second. The drone has spray efficiency of 1500-2550 square metre/ minute. “This initiative is expected to create employment and will boost economic activities in Naini Industrial Area, which is also an education hub. This would be first drone manufacturing facility in the northern India with a potential to add tremendous value to the industries such as security and surveillance besides agriculture, mapping of lands among other things to cater to the requirements within the country”, said chief executive officer, NAeL, RR Thakur in a statement. “This partnership will also strive to increase indigenisation of imported components required for manufacturing of drones. Most of the components amounting to around 75%, are presently being imported from China and many western countries,” he added. Naini based NAeL started its production in July 2017. It previously hogged the limelight when it bagged the order for manufacturing loom for Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) ‘Tejas’. Later, NAeL started to assemble structures of Dhruv helicopters. NAeL is also carrying out loom work of Cheetah, Chetak and Dornier aircraft and helicopters. More than 10,000 looms have been manufactured and installed in the aircraft. In November, 2022, NAeL proposed starting a course for remote pilot training organisation (RPTO) for training drone pilots in an area of around 10 acre land parcel. The organisation said drone pilots will be trained at the unit’s premises at Naini and it will commence by mid-2023. The license of the course it said will be taken from Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) to open the training centre. The partnership with NAeL further strengthens Garuda Aerospace’s leadership in India’s drone manufacturing ecosystem, said, Agnishwar Jayaprakash, Founder and CEO, Garuda Aerospace, who said that the “the company has seen a pre-booking of over 7000 drones at Rs. 4.5 lakhs each,” he said. Furthermore, Garuda Aerospace recently partnered with BEML at Aero India for drone manufacturing at their Mysore facility and initiated a massive indigenization campaign. The company has also collaborated with 120 local suppliers with the objective of reducing reliance on foreign imports of drone parts, components, and UAV subsystems. The factory is located on the Prayagraj-Mirzapur highway, approximately 20 km from Prayagraj city center. Naini, Prayagraj is being considered for inclusion in the proposed defence industrial corridor of Uttar Pradesh. According to data from the research firm Tracxn Technologies published in March this year, in FY2022-23, drone startups attracted $49.7 million in investments across 20 rounds, compared to $25 million received in FY2021-22 across 23 rounds. The figure for FY2020-21 was $11.2 million across 20 rounds. The government of India has earlier said that it has set a target of making at least one-lakh Made in India drones by 2024."

We are confident that they will go after those who violate the law and indulge in these hate crimes. I am quite confident that going forward, we will see a better situation.” After completing his Papua New Guinea trip, PM Modi is scheduled to visit Australia today. Responding to whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese will discuss the issue of vandalism of Hindu temples, Vohra said, “Vandalism of Hindu temples has been a concern in India and he has also raised a concern with Australian PM Anthony Albanese when he came to India. And we received a response from him as well.” Earlier during his visit to India in March, Albanese had reiterated that Australia will act with “full force” to prevent attacks against Hindu temples. The issue was raised by PM Modi in the Hyderabad House where the two sides held a formal dialogue. Modi had said the attacks on Hindu temples in Australia had “worried” India. Albanese gave assurance to PM Modi of taking “every action through our police and also our security agencies,” to “make sure that anyone responsible for this faces the full force of the law. “I gave him the assurance that Australia is a country that respects people’s faith. That we don’t tolerate the sort of extreme actions and attacks that we’ve seen on religious buildings, be they Hindu temples, mosques, synagogues, or churches. This has no place in Australia. We’re a tolerant multicultural nation, and there is no place in Australia for this activity,” said the Australian PM. In the past few months, the attacks on the Hindu temple have increased.

AMCA order book might swell to 200 due to SPV Model,https://idrw.org/amca-order-book-might-swell-to-200-due-to-spv-model/,"May 22, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) is expected to approve the indigenous Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a fifth-generation fighter aircraft being developed for the Indian Air Force. However, the clearance is likely to be granted later this year or early next year, as the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) has completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) of the program. Despite this progress, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) are yet to finalize private partners for the AMCA program, which was intended to be executed through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with private players holding a majority stake. HAL and DRDO have engaged in multiple discussions with potential partners, but concerns persist about the profitability of the SPV model. Previous reports by idrw indicate that talks have now shifted towards the promised order book, which presently stands at approximately 140 units for a total of 7 squadrons. This includes 40 units of the MkI variant and 100 units of the MkII variant, powered by a high-thrust engine. The timeline for the MkII variant of the AMCA is dependent on the completion of the New Engine deal, which is yet to be finalized. If there are any delays in the MkII program, the order size for the MkI variant may increase, especially if the CCS clearance comes by the end of this year. The first flight for the AMCA is planned for 2027-28. To ensure the SPV’s financial stability and repayment of debts and investments, larger order size is essential. To attract private partners and maintain aircraft production until 2045, the order size for the AMCA may need to be expanded. The current SPV model can’t count on prospective export orders unless the Indian Air Force (IAF) commits to orders before the program is executed. The SPV’s functioning would require certain guarantees from the government. The expansion of the order size is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the program and to enable private partners to participate effectively."

In an address at a G7 Working Session in Hiroshima, PM Modi also strongly pitched for raising voice collectively against unilateral attempts to change the status quo, asserting that any tension and dispute should be resolved peacefully through dialogue. The prime minister also referred to his talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday and reiterated that India will do whatever is possible to resolve the conflict. PM Modi’s comments came after Zelensky addressed the G7 leaders seeking global support for Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russian aggression. The war in Ukraine has been the overwhelming focus of the three-day summit. The prime minister also invoked Buddha and said there is no such problem in the modern age whose solution cannot be found in his teachings. He quoted Buddha to say that enmity is pacified by affinity and that “we should move forward together with everyone in this spirit.” “Today we heard from President Zelensky. I also met him yesterday. I do not consider the current situation as an issue of politics or economy. I believe it is an issue of humanity, an issue of human values,” the prime minister said. “We have said from the beginning, that dialogue and diplomacy is the only way. And to solve this situation, we will try as much as possible, whatever can be done from India,” he said. PM Modi said all countries must respect the UN Charter, international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations and called for raising voice together against unilateral attempts to change the status quo.

Raise your voice together against unilateral attempts to change the status quo,” he said. “India has always been of the opinion that any tension, any dispute should be resolved peacefully, through dialogue. And if a solution is found by law, it should be accepted. And in this spirit, India resolved its land and maritime boundary dispute with Bangladesh,” he said. The prime minister said that in the current global situation, the maximum and the most profound effects of the food, fuel and fertilizer crisis are being felt by the developing countries. “Global peace, stability and prosperity is a common objective of all of us. In today’s interconnected world, tension in any one region affects all countries. And, developing countries, which have limited resources, are affected the most,” he said. “Due to the current global situation, the maximum and most profound effects of the food, fuel and fertilizer crisis are being suffered by these countries,” he added. PM Modi said Buddha had given a solution centuries ago to war, unrest and instability that the world is facing today. “In India, and here in Japan too, Lord Buddha has been followed for thousands of years. There is no problem in the modern age, whose solution we cannot find in the teachings of Buddha,” he said. The group of seven (G7), comprising the US, France, the UK, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan, represent the world’s richest democracies.

Amid strain in ties India-Pakistan ties, the biennial SAARC summits have not taken place since the 2014 meeting in Kathmandu. “G20 is an event for the country but BJP has hijacked it, they have even replaced the logo with Lotus, the logo should have been something related to the country, not a party…it is the SAARC that will establish the leadership of our country within this region…why not have a SAARC summit and address our problem…,” she told media on the preparations for the G-20 grouping meeting on tourism in Srinagar from May 22 to 24. Meanwhile, Mehbooba Mufti hailed the people of Karnataka for giving a ray of hope to the entire country by defeating a “fascist, communal and divisive” BJP in the recently-concluded Assembly election.She, however, cautioned people against the developments that happened in Delhi, saying that it was a wake-up call for everyone as it can happen anywhere in the country. Mufti was referring to an ordinance passed by the President on Friday, May 20, giving overriding powers to the Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor — a union government nominee — to oversee the transfer, posting and disciplinary proceedings against civil servants in Delhi. The ordinance was brought in just a week after a Supreme Court Constitution Bench had ruled that powers over the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in the national capital lay with the Delhi government and not the Central government. The apex court had made it clear that the Central government cannot take over governance of elected state governments. “Karnataka has given a ray of hope to the entire country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and everyone in the BJP were using religion in the Karnataka elections but still people voted them out,” she said in a press conference here. According to her, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra had laid the foundation for Congress’ victory in Karnataka Assembly election. “Last five years were hit by hatred and communal politics. Divisive politics was played here also in Karnataka. Now Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar will heal the wounds,” the PDP chief said."

(If there is a heaven on earth, it is here.)” Under India’s presidency, the third G20 Tourism Working Group meeting is scheduled to take place in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir from May 22-24. The tourism industry has played a crucial role in the development of the Union Territory. However, years of instability have impacted the tourism industry, leading to a decline in the number of visitors. The G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in Jammu and Kashmir promises to initiate a tidal wave of transformative outcomes, setting the region on a new trajectory towards stability, economic growth, and social development. People directly or indirectly connected with the tourism sector in Kashmir believe that the G20 meeting can attract investors and tourists from across the globe. They say that it will not only promote Jammu and Kashmir at the international level but the tourism sector of Kashmir will get a new dimension. Various departments are busy preparing for the G20 meeting to be held in Srinagar, while many others have finalised their preparations. There is also a program for the visit of delegates from 20 countries to the city of Gulmarg and Dal Lake. A large part of it has already been cleaned and the cleaning work on the other part is going on in full swing. The sanitation work is carried out in Dal throughout the year. But for the G20 meeting, special attention is being paid to the cleaning of several important places in the lake. India assumed the presidency of the G20 grouping on December 1, 2022, and will hold the post for a year. Meanwhile on Friday, China maintained its firm stance and said that it will not attend the next week’s G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in Jammu and Kashmir, stating that it opposes holding any such meetings in the “disputed territory.” “China firmly opposes holding any form of G20 meetings on disputed territory. We will not attend such meetings,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a regular press conference when asked about several reports doing the rounds that China will boycott G20 meetings planned in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Incidentally, China is a close ally of Pakistan and relations between India and Pakistan have been precarious for many years with regard to cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan."

The Ministry of Defense (MoD) in India is now focusing on the development of locally produced self-propelled air defence gun missile systems (SPAD-GMS) as replacements for the ageing Towed Bofors L 70 40mm single-barrel and Soviet-era ZU-23-2 towed 23mm twin-barrel weapon systems. Initially, the plan is to acquire 104 units of SPAD-GMS, which will later be expanded to a total of 300 units. Since 2013, the Indian Army has evaluated five different SPAD-GMS options, but none have fully met its requirements. The K30 system manufactured by South Korea’s Hanwha Defense came close to meeting the criteria, but due to allegations that it did not meet all parameters and objections from the Russian side, which had offered the Tunguska system by Almaz Ante and Pantsir by KBP Tula systems, the plan to proceed with the K30 was abandoned. In parallel, there are ongoing discussions between the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the Indian Army, and private sector companies regarding the development of a SPAD-GMS variant based on a light tank-based platform. The prototype of the Light Tank is scheduled to be rolled out later this year. The proposed SPAD-GMS system will consist of twin 30mm guns, surveillance and fire-control radar, an electro-optical targeting system (EOTS), a panoramic periscope, a forward-looking infrared system (FLIR), a laser rangefinder (LRF), thermal sight, TV camera, and a digital fire-control system. The primary challenge will be integrating and testing such a system to ensure it meets the Qualitative Requirements (QRs) set forth by the Indian Army. Once the discussions between the Indian Army and DRDO conclude, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) may allocate funds for the development of the SPAD-GMS system. The decision to abandon the retrial and not proceed with the K30 system, which came close to securing the contract, is rooted in concerns regarding corruption allegations and the system’s failure to meet all desired parameters. Additionally, there have been serious allegations that the K30 system itself is obsolete."

“We Strongly Oppose…”: Quad Countries’ Thinly Veiled Swipe At China,https://idrw.org/we-strongly-oppose-quad-countries-thinly-veiled-swipe-at-china/,"May 21, 2023","SOURCE: AFP The leaders of the Quad group — Australia, India, Japan and the United States — delivered a thinly veiled swipe at Beijing’s behaviour Saturday at a summit in Hiroshima. US President Joe Biden and his three partners in the group did not mention China by name but the communist superpower was clearly the target of language in a joint statement calling for “peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific maritime domain”. “We strongly oppose destabilizing or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” the statement said, using diplomatic language that appeared to refer to China’s economic tactics to gain leverage over poorer countries and also its military expansion in the Pacific. “We express serious concern at the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coastguard and maritime militia vessels, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities,” the statement added, clearly referring to Chinese construction of bases on former offshore reefs and harassment of non-Chinese vessels in disputed waters. The Quad leaders held their meeting while already gathered in Hiroshima for a Group of 7 summit. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had been meant to host Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Sydney next week. However, Biden pulled out, saying he had to return to Washington from Japan on Sunday to negotiate with Republican opponents on the US debt ceiling. Biden apologised for forcing the change in plans and has invited Albanese to make a state visit to the White House. In their statement, they stressed the Quad’s support for infrastructure improvements across the vast Asia-Pacific region, while saying, in another apparent dig at China, that they wanted to assist such investments but would “not impose unsustainable debt burdens” on recipients of assistance. Among the projects the Quad leaders highlighted was the “urgent need to support quality undersea cable networks in the Indo-Pacific, which are key to global growth and prosperity”. They announced a partnership aiming to draw on their countries’ expertise in the specialist maritime cable sector. They also said that an existing pilot programme for high-tech monitoring of illegal fishing would expand. And they said they were “deeply concerned” by repression in Myanmar, and they condemned “North Korea’s destabilizing ballistic missile launches and pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions”."
"As India decks up to hold G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in J-K, Pak FM Bilawal visits PoK",https://idrw.org/as-india-decks-up-to-hold-g20-tourism-working-group-meeting-in-j-k-pak-fm-bilawal-visits-pok/,"May 22, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Sunday kickstarted his 3-day long visit to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) where he will also deliver an address to the people residing in the region, reported Dawn. Bilawal’s visit to PoK comes at a time when India decks up to host the third G20 Tourism Working Group Meeting’ in Jammu and Kashmir from Monday (May 22) amid high security. Under India’s presidency, the third G20 Tourism Working Group meeting is scheduled to take place in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir from May 22-24. Time and again Pakistan has shown strong discontent at New Delhi’s intention to convene the G20 Tourism Working Group conference in Kashmir. Rejecting Pakistan’s criticism, India had said G20 meetings are being organized in the entire country and hence it is “natural” to hold meetings in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as “these are inalienable parts of India.” Pakistan recently slammed India’s decision to host a G20 meeting in Srinagar and parts of Kashmir as an “irresponsible move”. “G20 meetings are being organized in entire India, in all cities and parts of India. It is therefore natural to hold the meetings in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh because these are inalienable parts of India,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Official Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during the MEA Weekly Media Briefing. “That is what I would like to say. The meetings are being held in all parts of India, that is our natural response,” the MEA official spokesperson said. India announced Srinagar as the venue for the G20 Tourism Working Group meeting scheduled to take place from May 22 to 24. The relations between India and Pakistan have been precarious for many years with regard to cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. Moreover, New Delhi has consistently raised the issue of Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism and terrorist infiltration. It has been said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have borne the brunt of this terrorism campaign for decades and continue to do so. Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari recently visited India for Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Goa in May. At the meeting, he made remarks on not getting “caught up in weaponising terrorism for diplomatic point scoring.” Following that, he was lambasted by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who said that it means “they think terrorism is legitimate” and that India is politically, and diplomatically exposing Pakistan before the world as it is a victim of cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar, who addressed a press conference after the meeting of SCO Foreign Ministers, said India is defending itself against terrorism. “The weaponization. It’s a very interesting statement because it unconsciously reveals a mindset. What does weaponizing something mean? It means that the activity is legitimate and somebody is weaponizing it. So you say you are weaponizing trade, you are weaponizing technology. Somebody says you are weaponizing terrorism, which means they think terrorism is legitimate, and that we should not weaponize it. That is normal,” said Jaishankar. However, Bilawal termed Jaishankar’s comments about him being a perpetrator of terrorism as a “joke”, the Dawn reported. “This country knows me, have I once even in my political history accidentally sat down with a terrorist?,” Dawn quoted Bilawal Bhutto Zardari as saying. “They don’t see that even in our country we (PPP) perform a role in the first ranks against appeasing terrorists,” he added. As of now, the G20 Working group meeting in Jammu and Kashmir will focus on five key priority areas: Green Tourism, Digitalization, Skills, MSMEs and Destination Management. The meeting aims to strengthen economic growth, preserve cultural heritage and promote sustainable development of the region. The event will witness the participation of G20 member countries, invited countries, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Chief Coordinator G20 said, that it is the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the message of India’s G20 Presidency is taken to the grassroot level through active Jan Bhagidari. Shringla appreciated the efforts of the Government to sensitise the people about the goals and purpose of G20 through multiple public activities. The tourism industry has played a crucial role in the development of the Union Territory. However, years of instability have impacted the tourism industry, leading to a decline in the number of visitors. Incidentally, China, which is a close ally of Pakistan on Friday said that it will not attend the next week’s G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in Jammu and Kashmir, stating that it is “firmly” opposed to holding any such meetings in the “disputed territory.” “China firmly opposes holding any form of G20 meetings on disputed territory. We will not attend such meetings,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a regular press conference when asked about several reports doing the rounds that China will boycott G20 meetings planned in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. India assumed the presidency of the G20 grouping on December 1, 2022, and will hold the post for a year. The G20 summit in Jammu and Kashmir promises to initiate a tidal wave of transformative outcomes, setting the region on a new trajectory towards stability, economic growth, and social development."

This decision aims to promote tourism and provide easier access to the breathtaking beauty of the Siachen Glacier, known as the world’s highest battlefield. Previously, visiting the Siachen Glacier required special permits due to security concerns and the presence of Indian Army personnel in the area. However, with the revised guidelines, tourists can now explore this pristine Himalayan region more freely. The move is expected to boost tourism in the region, offering visitors the opportunity to witness the majestic landscapes and experience the unique environment of the Siachen Glacier. It is also seen as a positive step towards showcasing the natural wonders of India and encouraging sustainable tourism in the area. While tourists are no longer required to obtain Army permission, it is important to note that certain guidelines and regulations must still be followed to ensure safety and environmental preservation. The Indian Army will continue to maintain a presence in the region for security purposes. This decision is a welcome move that will not only enhance tourism prospects but also allow more people to appreciate the natural beauty and significance of the Siachen Glacier, further promoting India’s rich cultural and geographical diversity."

In an address at a session of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, PM Modi also pitched for checking the “expansionist mentality” occupying the fertiliser resources and strongly batted for the democratisation of technology. The prime minister’s 10-point action plan included curbing wastage of food, depoliticisation of global fertilizer supply chains, promoting millets, encouraging holistic healthcare, strengthening digital health care and building development models inspired by the needs of developing countries. There is a need to focus on the holistic use of natural resources and the development model inspired by consumerism has to be changed, PM Modi said. The prime minister said efforts should be put to build an inclusive food system that focuses on the world’s most vulnerable people, especially “marginal farmers should be our priority”. “The global fertiliser supply chains have to be strengthened. Political obstacles in this have to be removed. And the expansionist mentality that is occupying the fertilizer resources has to be stopped. This should be the purpose of our cooperation,” he said. The prime minister, however, did not name any country. PM Modi also emphasised preventing the wastage of food saying it should be “our collective responsibility”. “It is essential for sustainable global food security,” he said. The group of seven (G7), comprising the US, France, the UK, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan, represent the world’s richest democracies. Under its G7 presidency, Japan invited India and seven other countries to the summit. PM Modi also underlined the need for focusing on development, technology and democracy together. “It is necessary to democratise technology. Technology can become a bridge between development and democracy,” he said. The prime minister also noted that the model of development should pave the way for welfare and not become a hindrance in the progress of developing countries. “I am confident that our discussions today will be useful in creating an important link between the agenda of the G20 and the G7. And will be successful in prioritising the hopes and expectations of the Global South,” he said. The prime minister also highlighted the importance of natural farming. “We can create a new model of natural farming as an alternative to fertilisers around the world. I believe that we should take the benefit of digital technology to every farmer in the world,” he said. PM Modi said that there is a need to separate organic food from “fashion statement and commerce” and instead, it should be linked to nutrition and health. PM Modi also spoke about the advantages of millets. “Millets simultaneously address the challenges of nutrition, climate change, water conservation and food security. Awareness should be created on this,” he said. At another session, PM Modi identified climate change, environmental security and energy security as some of the biggest challenges facing the world. “To solve all these challenges, we have to listen to the call of the earth. You have to change your behavior accordingly,” he said. “Moving forward in the direction of climate action, we have to make green and clean technology supply chains resilient,” he said. “If we do not provide technology transfer and affordable financing to the needy countries, then our discussions will remain only discussions. There will be no change on the ground,” he said. “I can proudly say that the people of India are conscious towards the environment and understand their responsibilities. This sense of responsibility has been flowing in our veins for centuries,” he said. The prime minister said India is fully prepared to make its contribution together with all."

This includes rigorous testing, training, and equipping the aircraft carrier to perform air combat operations effectively. The successful berthing of INS Vikrant at the newly constructed Aircraft Carrier pier in Karwar reaffirms India’s commitment to bolstering its naval capabilities and promoting indigenous defense manufacturing. The project’s completion not only enhances the nation’s maritime power but also serves as a testament to India’s technological advancements and self-reliance in the defense sector."
Houses of 5 Pakistan-Based Terrorists Raided In Jammu And Kashmir’s Doda,https://idrw.org/houses-of-5-pakistan-based-terrorists-raided-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-doda/,"May 21, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police on Saturday raided the houses of five local terrorists who are currently operating from across the border and making desperate attempts to revive militancy in Doda district, a senior police officer said. Senior Superintendent of Police of Doda district Abdul Qayoom said the raids were conducted by the SIU in the Gandoh area in connection with a case registered against the five terrorists in 2021 under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The officer said the searches would help gather evidence and identify their supporters and sympathizers who are working as overground workers. The terrorists whose houses were searched were Atta Mohd alias “Adil Mubassir” of Tanta Kahara, Mohd Yasir alias “Shahid” of Kunthal-Tanta, Mohd Shafi alias “Nadeem Bhai” and Amjid Ali alias “Rashid” of Trinkal Kahara, and Majid Hussain alias “Abu Zahid Saqib” of Manoie Chilli Pingal, the SSP said. “All these local terrorists have ex-filtrated to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in the early 1990s and are currently operating from Pakistan. They are making desperate attempts to revive militancy in Doda by way of contacting the local youth through virtual mode and instigating them to join militancy,” Abdul Qayoom said."

G20 meet in Kashmir creates panic in Pakistan,https://idrw.org/g20-meet-in-kashmir-creates-panic-in-pakistan/,"May 20, 2023","SOURCE: IANS Speaking to Pakistani journalists in Goa where he was attending the Conference of Foreign Ministers of SCO, Pakistan’s foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a thinly veiled threat to the host country India. Responding to a question on the Pakistani stand on the G20 meeting on tourism in Srinagar in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Zardari declared that “when the time is right we shall give a befitting reply which India will never forget.” A couple of weeks earlier, the Pakistan foreign office had officially condemned the Indian decision to hold a G20 meeting in Srinagar. There were also reports that Pakistani diplomacy was going to go into an overdrive to campaign against holding of this meeting in Kashmir. Earlier, Pakistan had tried to block the G20 meetings in Jammu city in the Union Territory. But that effort fizzled out. Clearly, Pakistan believed that it couldn’t allow the same to happen to its campaign against the Srinagar meeting. For an Islamic State like Pakistan, Muslim majority Srinagar is far more critical than Hindu dominated Jammu and it would pull out all stops to deny, disrupt and sabotage this meeting. That Pakistan is rattled by India hosting a G20 meeting in Kashmir is quite apparent. Pakistan thinks that if this meeting takes place, it will deal a body blow to its claims that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed area. While India will gain international legitimacy on Kashmir, Pakistan will lose its case if the 20 most developed economies meet in Srinagar because it will be tantamount to putting a de facto seal of approval over Indian claims on the ‘disputed’ region. Not surprisingly, Pakistan is hoping to convince some of its friends in G20 – China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Indonesia – to boycott the Srinagar meeting in solidarity with Pakistan. But until now, except for China which skipped the meeting in Arunachal Pradesh, and perhaps Turkey, none of the other countries have indicated any reservations about going to Srinagar. The noise coming out of Pakistan really doesn’t make any sense. It isn’t as if representatives of foreign countries haven’t travelled to Jammu and Kashmir in the past. In fact diplomats from different countries have gone to J&K on their own and as part of delegations facilitated by the Indian government. Incidentally, similar tours have taken place on the Pakistan-occupied parts of the territory. Foreign tourists, journalists and even investors have been visiting the Kashmir valley. Recently an investors conference was held in which both UAE and Saudi Arabia participated. In fact, the UAE has unveiled ambitious plans for investing in the Union Territory. Investors from other countries have also shown interest in becoming part of the growth story in Jammu and Kashmir. Clearly, Pakistan’s protestations are quite meaningless and mendacious. The bottom-line is that India doesn’t need the stamp of G20 to justify her claim on J&K. That claim is well-established and well-accepted, more so after the constitutional reforms of 2019 in the erstwhile state. The G20 meeting is being held in Srinagar not because India wants to cock a snook at Pakistan, but because Kashmir is a part of India. If similar meetings are being held in each and every state and Union Territory of India, then they will also be held in Jammu and Kashmir. Just because Pakistan has a fictitious claim on the territory, there is no reason for India to kowtow to Pakistan’s demands. In any case, there can be no place more appropriate to hold a meeting on tourism than a tourism paradise like Kashmir. Unfortunately, for nearly three decades, Kashmir has been a tragic victim of Jihadist terrorism sponsored and supported by Pakistan. It lost its place as the jewel in India’s tourism map because of the violence that Pakistani agent provocateurs unleashed in the region. Only in the last couple of years has Kashmir once again become a haven for tourists. Record numbers of Indian and foreign tourists have been going to the Union Territory. It is difficult to find a hotel room in the Valley. Meanwhile, the tourism boom has led to new hotels coming up. Locals have set up top class B&Bs. Local entrepreneurs – hoteliers, tour operators, craftsmen, restauranteurs, cafes, retailers, you name it – have been profiting from the revival of tourism, which itself is a function of the restoration of normalcy in the Valley. For India, G20 is an excellent opportunity for showcasing the return of normalcy in Kashmir. The fake news, narrative and propaganda on Kashmir being peddled by countries like Pakistan under the tutelage and guidance of Turkey is best busted by allowing, even encouraging, foreign tourists to travel to the proverbial ‘Heaven on Earth’. No amount of advertising or publicity campaigns to convince people to travel to Kashmir are as effective as accounts of travellers who have witnessed first-hand the change that has come in the Union Territory. Except for citizens and reports of hostile countries like Pakistan, China and Turkey, there should be absolutely no restrictions on foreign media from going to and reporting from Kashmir. There will always be some reports who will look for negative stories and file what can be called ‘drain inspector’s reports’. These reporters will look for stories that reinforce their prejudice, bias and agenda against India. But there will be many more reporters who will go with an open mind and report what is an objective reality of the situation in Kashmir. They will see the positive energy in Jammu and Kashmir, the development that is taking place, the mainstreaming that is being encouraged and promoted. The G20 is only the start of this process. Conferencing in Kashmir is now becoming a thing and will only grow. Pakistan will of course do its damnedest best to undermine and sabotage the progress that is visible in the Valley. The only images coming out of Kashmir that Pakistan wants to see is of death, destruction and desolation. That is the reason why Pakistani media often airs footage from years ago to plug the fake narrative of a Kashmir that is burning. But fakery has a shelf-life and Pakistan’s efforts to stall the return of normalcy in Kashmir is way past its sell-by date."

But the visit was postponed due to elections in India and our own busy schedule. I am now going after the budget,” he added. The Budget will be presented in the house on May 29."

IAF to restart hunt for VVIP Helicopters,https://idrw.org/iaf-to-restart-hunt-for-vvip-helicopters/,"May 20, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to reactivate a tender to procure new VVIP helicopters that will be used for the president, prime minister, and other VVIPs. This decision comes after successfully resolving the previously cancelled AgustaWestland chopper scam. The IAF, in consultation with organizations like the Special Protection Group (SPG), National Security Guard (NSG), and others, will soon float an open tender to seek new helicopters. Currently, the Mi-17-5 helicopters are being used for VVIP duties, but they lack integrated protections against multi-level threats. Therefore, the IAF intends to replace them with new helicopters that offer enhanced security features. In February 2010, during the ruling UPA government, a contract was signed to purchase 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters for the Indian Air Force for Rs 3,600 crore. These helicopters were intended to transport the president, prime minister, and other VVIPs. However, in 2013, the chairman of Finmeccanica, Giuseppe Orsi, and the CEO of AgustaWestland, Bruno Spagnolini, was arrested on charges of bribing middlemen to secure the deal with the IAF. In 2014, the Congress-led UPA government cancelled the VVIP chopper deal with AgustaWestland due to violations of the integrity pact. The Indian government has since recovered most of the money paid to the Italian company for the contract. In 2022, the NDA government decided to lift the ban on dealings with the Italian firm Leonardo (previously known as Finmeccanica). India has successfully recovered the full amount of the deal through bank guarantees and has agreed to the return of three AW101 helicopters that were previously stored at the IAF base in Palam."

India is making significant strides towards the establishment of an Integrated Rocket Force (IRF) in response to the ongoing military standoff with China. As part of this development, the country is focusing on the creation of next-generation multiple-launch rocket systems, which will serve as crucial components of the IRF and engage important targets located deep within enemy territory. Currently, India operates the indigenously developed 214 mm Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher family, with a range ranging from the older variant of 37.5 km to the Mk-II ER variant, which boasts a range of 90 km. However, the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) aims to go beyond this and develop next-generation multiple-launch rocket systems in the calibre category above 300 mm. This endeavour has also attracted competition from the private sector. Solar Industries India, a private company, is actively working on two guided missiles known as Maheshwarastra 1 and Maheshwarastra 2. Maheshwarastra 1 will have a range of 150 km, while Maheshwarastra 2 will have an extended range of 290 km. Both programs are company-funded and have received approval from the Ministry of Defense. Another private sector company, JSR Dynamics, claims to be developing a 324 mm calibre Guided Rocket system with a range of 250 to 300 km. This system will possess guided capacity, enhancing its precision targeting capabilities. JSR Dynamics plans to develop the airframe and guidance system in-house, while discussions are ongoing with a European company to secure highly specific impulse propellant. DRDO itself intends to develop a 300 mm calibre Guided Rocket system with a maximum firing range of up to 150 km. This system will utilize inertial and satellite navigation systems for guidance. While it may seem that multiple projects are duplicating efforts, each program will possess distinct capabilities. The presence of multiple production lines and different classes of rocket systems will prove advantageous for the IRF, as it will play a crucial offensive role in India’s defence strategy."

In an interview with Japanese publication Nikkei Asia, PM Modi said,”the future development of the India-China relationship can only be based on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests”, and noted that “normalising” the ties would benefit the wider region and the world. He stressed on his country’s respect for sovereignty, the rule of law and the peaceful resolution of disputes. India-China ties have been fraught since the Galwan clashes in 2020. Both sides have been periodically holding meetings to defuse the crisis at the border but a lasting solution has eluded them so far. On Pakistan, the publication quoted him as saying that India wants “normal and neighborly relations.” “However, it is incumbent upon them to create a conducive environment free from terrorism and hostilities. The onus is on Pakistan to take necessary steps in this regard,” he said. Speaking about the Indian economy, he noted that it has been one of the world’s fastest-growing. “Our progress is evident, as we have risen from being the tenth largest economy in 2014 to now being the fifth largest globally… While it is true that global headwinds pose challenges to growth, we have built a strong foundation in recent years, which positions us favorably,” he said. On the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Modi said India’s position on the matter “is clear and unwavering.” “India stands on the side of peace and will remain firmly there. We are committed to supporting those who face challenges in meeting their basic needs, especially in the face of rising costs of food, fuel, and fertilizers. We maintain communication with both Russia and Ukraine,” PM Modi said. “Cooperation and collaboration should define our times, not conflict,” he told Nikkei Asia. The Prime Minister is on a three-nation trip to Japan, Papua New Guinea and Australia.

India, which holds the chair of G20 this year, has organised a series of meetings across the country in the run-up to the summit in New Delhi in September. “China is firmly opposed to holding any kind of G20 meetings in disputed territory, and will not attend such meetings,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. In 2019, India split the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir to create the two federal territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. A large chunk of Ladakh is under Chinese control. Ties between New Delhi and Beijing have been strained since a military clash in Ladakh in 2020 in which 24 soldiers were killed. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, will host a meeting of the tourism working group for G20 members on May 22-24. Kashmir is claimed in full but ruled in part by nuclear-armed neighbours India and China-ally Pakistan, which has also opposed India’s decision to hold a G20 meeting in Kashmir. India has countered the objection saying it is free to hold meetings on its own territory. It said on Friday peace and tranquility on its border is essential for normal ties with China."

So tomorrow, in addition to the G7, President Biden will participate in the third in-person Quad Leaders’ meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India,” read a statement by White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Earlier this week, the planned summit of Quad leaders from the US, India, Australia, and Japan in Sydney was cancelled after Biden withdrew from his visit due to ongoing debt limit talks in Washington. “Along with sharing strategic assessments, the leaders will welcome new forms of Quad cooperation on secure digital technology, submarine cables, infrastructure capacity building, and maritime domain awareness,” said Jean-Pierre adding that Biden had thanked his fellow Quad leaders “for their flexibility,” and “looks forward to rescheduling his trip.” Earlier this week, Biden scrapped his planned trip to Sydney as well as a historic visit to Papua New Guinea. The decision — which prompted Albanese to cancel the scheduled Quad summit — was seen as a self-inflicted blow to hopes of a more visible U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific amid its competition with China in the region. The White House said Thursday that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would travel to Papua New Guinea in place of Biden to sign two security agreements, on defense cooperation and maritime surveillance, with the Pacific island nation in a bid to shore up support among countries in the region for countering Beijing, which has been extending its clout in the area."

Why Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has importance for India?,https://idrw.org/why-shanghai-cooperation-organisation-has-importance-for-india/,"May 20, 2023","SOURCE: ANI India assumed the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) Chairship for 2023 and it already held meetings at the level of Directors of the National Security Agency, Defense Ministers, and Foreign Ministers. An article from a magazine, ‘Wedge’ dated May 16, 2023, written by Japanese scholar Satoru Nagao, who works with the Sasakawa Peace Foundation provides a perspective as to why India is focusing on its active participation in SCO. The article has noted the current pattern of partnerships within SCO. The writer has appreciated India’s diplomatic approach towards SCO. The SCO provides a platform for India to enhance economic cooperation with Central Asian countries, which have vast reserves of natural resources. India is seeking to increase its trade and investment ties with the SCO countries to diversify its economic partnerships. The G7 Summit scheduled to be held in Hiroshima from May 19 to 21, would be followed by the QUAD Summit (May 24), a four-country framework which includes- the US, Japan, Australia and India, (earlier QUAD Summit was planned to be held in Sydney, however now the meeting will be held in Hiroshima itself). Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will also have the opportunity to hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the G20 Summit (India). Since Prime Minister Kishida visited India in March this year, he has been meeting PM Modi quite often and this has attracted the attention of experts on Japan-India relations. However, there is one more aspect that has not received much focus in Japan. India is also chairing the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) this year, said Satoru. India will host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in New Delhi On July 3-4. The agenda for the Summit is anticipated to centre on counter-terror, Afghan stability, and inclusive connectivity efforts including Chabahar Port & INSTC, aside from India’s extensive outreach to Eurasia. India is deepening cooperation with Japan and the US in areas such as QUAD and the Indo-Pacific. Then why is it a member of the SCO? What kind of national interest lies there for India? asked Satoru. As per his article in Wedge, the SCO is a countermeasure against Pakistan. For India, the SCO holds the potential to serve the purpose in terms of security. For India, dealing with China and Pakistan is a security challenge. Pakistan, in particular, sends Islamic extremists to India, said Satoru. Pakistan lost the Indo-Pakistani War in 1971 and was made aware of the huge power difference with India. Since then, as a countermeasure against India, along with the development of nuclear weapons, the strategy adopted by Pakistan has been to support Islamic extremists, who carry out terrorist activities against India, more actively than ever before. The so-called ‘Thousand Wounds Strategy’ states that even a strong country would turn weak if it inflicted a thousand small wounds through terrorism. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and the US, via Pakistan, supported the guerrillas against the Soviet Union. During this process, Pakistan developed the know-how to support terrorists. Volunteer soldiers ready to fight against the Soviet Union began to gather from all over the world, including Islamic extremists as well. One amongst them was Osama bin Laden who later masterminded the 9/11 attacks. By establishing connections with such Islamic extremists, Pakistan deepened its confidence in supporting terrorism. Then, after the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, Pakistan began to think of a strategy of sending allied Islamic extremists to India. Thus, Pakistan-backed Islamist extremist terrorism plagued India. As a countermeasure against terrorism, information regarding Islamic extremists possessed by Russia and Central Asian countries became important for India, said Satoru. Founded in 2001, the SCO consists of China, Russia and Central Asian countries. It is an apt framework for sharing information about Islamic extremists. However, there was a problem. There was a possibility of Pakistan joining the group. China had supported Pakistan for many years and now Pakistan was seeking its entry in SCO. What would have happened, had India not joined and only Pakistan had joined SCO? Pakistan justifies Islamic extremists group, who carry out terrorism against India, by referring to them as ‘freedom fighters’. Pakistan would have tried to persuade the participant countries not to cooperate with India, said the article. For India, this was unacceptable. It was a must for India also to join the SCO and refute Pakistan’s claims. Hence, in 2015, India and Pakistan both joined the SCO at the same time. From the beginning, SCO has been a useful forum for countering Pakistan and Islamic extremists. India, which is chairing SCO this year, did not allow high-ranking Pakistani government officials to enter India for the National Security Director-General level and Defense Minister-level talks. They were allowed to participate only through online mode. During the Foreign Minister level talks, the Pakistani foreign minister was allowed to enter India for the talks, but he did not hold bilateral talks with his Indian counterpart. India’s anger towards Pakistan was being reflected. Moreover, in Central Asia, developments that are worrying for India continue. In particular, what is more, worrisome now is the move by China-Pakistan-Taliban to cooperate through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China, in cooperation with Pakistan, intends to proceed with infrastructure development projects, under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, under the BRI. China further intends to acquire Afghanistan’s mineral resources and develop trade routes. As a result, China’s stance of defending the Taliban along with Pakistan has turned out to be conspicuous, reported the Wedge article. For example, while the Taliban have pursued a policy of oppression against women unlike any other country, China and Pakistan are urging the rest of the world not to cut aid to Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. On the other hand, while India does not recognise the Taliban regime, it has reopened the Indian embassy in Afghanistan. However, they are training female Special Forces personnel with the intention of sending female armed forces to the security unit there. India is directly opposed to the Taliban’s repressive policies against women. In fact, India was also planning to develop a trade route connecting India and Central Asia until the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and gradual establishment of Taliban regime. India built the Iranian port of Chabahar and developed a trade route from India to Iran by sea, bypassing Pakistan, and from there to Afghanistan and Turkmenistan by land. That would allow India to engage in trade routes through Central Asia and make economic gains, and cooperate with former Afghan government to encircle Pakistan. Having said that, SCO was useful in negotiating with these countries, said Satoru. However, that became difficult with the rise of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Reason being that the Taliban regime has close ties with Pakistan and has fought with India. India’s relation with Iran is also not in smooth phase and has got complicated following India’s close proximity with US. Hence, for India the opportunity to proceed with the negotiation, using the SCO framework, for building this route, was lost. If viewed through this aspect, the SCO is not only a place for India to cooperate, but also a place to gather information, monitor and obstruct China-Pakistan movements. That’s where its real worth for India lies, said Satoru. India in the midst of a framework, which is turning into a confusing mystery. At first glance, the SCO looks like a framework promoting cooperation among anti-US countries. It has come up with a certain degree of success with regard to the China-Russia-Central Asia agreement. However, within it also exists simmering elements like India and China-Pakistan. Moreover, now, more such simmering elements have also started cropping up successively. In 2021, when Iran became an official member, Saudi Arabia joined as a Dialogue Partner. Azerbaijan and Armenia, both having territorial disputes, are also Dialogue Partners. Besides these, other countries also joined one after another, creating a strange framework, as in how do their ideas and views match and find a conclusion. Judging from the situation, it may be concluded that a consensus can be reached only among China, Russia, and Central Asia, while it would be better if the other countries attempt to arrive at an agreement on their relationship on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the value of SCO to China-Russia-Central Asian countries and its value to India are considered to be completely different. For India, the SCO is useful because it can curb Pakistan’s influence, get hold of information on Islamic extremists, and sabotage China-Pakistan cooperation, added Satoru. It can be said that it reflects the skilful and prudent diplomatic measures adopted by India in keeping with the clear objective of persistently pursuing its own national interest."

It said a number of policy reforms have been taken to achieve the objective of ease of doing business, including the integration of MSMEs and start-ups into the supply chain. The ministry said defence industries, including the MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) and start-ups, have been coming forward in design, development and manufacturing of military hardware. “There is almost a 200 per cent increase in the number of defence licenses issued to the industries in the last seven-eight years by the government,” the ministry said. “These measures have given a boost to the defence industrial manufacturing ecosystem in the country and generated tremendous employment opportunities,” it said. India is one of the largest importers of arms globally. According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years. The government now wants to reduce dependence on imported military platforms and has decided to support domestic defence manufacturing. The Defence Ministry has set a goal of a turnover of USD 25 billion (Rs 1.75 lakh crore) in defence manufacturing by 2024-25 that included an export target of USD 5 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) worth of military hardware."

Navy Begins Sea Trials of Kalvari Class Submarine Vaghsheer,https://idrw.org/navy-begins-sea-trials-of-kalvari-class-submarine-vaghsheer/,"May 19, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The Indian Navy’s sixth and final Kalvari class submarine, Vaghsheer, has begun its sea trials and is expected to be commissioned into the force by early next year. The commissioning of the submarine, built under Project-75, is set to enhance the Navy’s combat capability at a time when China has been increasing its presence in the Indian Ocean region. “The sixth submarine of Project-75 commenced her sea trials on May 18,” the Navy said. Vaghsheer is scheduled for delivery to the Indian Navy in early 2024 after completion of the sea trials. The submarine was launched in April last year from the Kanhoji Angre Wet Basin of the Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL). India has been focusing on bolstering its maritime capability with a focus on the Indian Ocean in the backdrop of concerns over China’s growing forays into the region, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy. The Project-75 includes indigenous construction of six submarines. The submarines are being constructed at the Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) in Mumbai under a collaboration with the Naval Group of France. Five of the Kalvari class of submarines have already been commissioned into the Indian Navy. “The MDL has delivered three submarines of Project-75 in 24 months and the commencement of sea trials of the sixth submarine is a significant milestone. This is indicative of the boost towards ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India),” the Navy said in a statement. “The submarine will now undergo intense trials of all its systems at sea, these include propulsion systems, weapons and sensors,” it said."
"Qatargate bribery: Does EU’s infamous scandal targeting Kashmir have Turkish, Pak roots?",https://idrw.org/qatargate-bribery-does-eus-infamous-scandal-targeting-kashmir-have-turkish-pak-roots/,"May 19, 2023","SOURCE: IANS The European Parliament’s Qatargate bribery scandal is now touching Indian shores. A number of websites in Europe have reported how various countries and individuals seem to be influencing the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) narrative in Europe. In the latest, the South Asia Press run by exiled Pakistani journalist Taha Siddiqui says that with the latest revelations, Turkey and Pakistan have been linked to the Qatargate scandal through Turkish-British lawyer Hakan Camuz. Camuz, who had filed cases in London against the Indian Army chief and the Home Minister for alleged war crimes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in 2021 has admitted to funding an ex-Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who is under investigation for the Qatargate bribery scandal in Belgium and Italy. Camuz had filed anti-India cases before the Metropolitan Police through his legal firm Stoke White based on investigations by Pakistani entity – Legal Forum for Oppressed Voices of Kashmir (LFOVK). The LFOVK is run by former Pakistani Judge, Justice Ali Nawaz Chowhan and Advocate Nasir Qadri, says the report. Pakistani judge Chowhan has been advocating “lawfare” against India over J&K. Some Europe-based news websites claim that Qadri has close links to Pakistani agency ISI, the radical party Jamaat-e-Islami (JI). He is a frequent visitor to Turkey, one of the few European nations siding with Pakistan to orchestrate the Kashmir issue. Qadri had also started a hashtag on social media platforms asking for the arrest of the Indian Army chief. The Turkish lawyer, who is based in London, is said to be close to Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his family. Greek website Directus quotes Camuz as saying: “Kashmiri Muslims have only international law to turn to after decades of seeking justice in their own country and only being subjected to further violence for doing so. This means Stoke White must begin the process of justice on their behalf, in a country that we understand respects the rule of law.” Camuz now claims that his company signed contracts for “parliamentary services” and paid Euro 75,000 to a company Equality Consultancy. The firm, in turn, is linked to ex-MEP Antonio Panzeri and his assistant Francesco Giorgi. Panzeri, who is currently jailed, remains a focal point of the Qatargate bribery scandal that has rocked Europe’s conscience. A Financial Times article also quoted Camuz saying that he had hired the discredited firm of Panzeri and Giorgi for “ethical lobbying services”, which he now claims were for “services” that included fixing meetings with MPs of the European Parliament, holding public events in Brussels, raising questions in the European parliament and getting EU funds for his charitable projects. Camuz has defended himself by saying that he was approached by Giorgi and he was keen to take up human rights campaigns on Syria and Yemen. Panzeri is being investigated by various authorities for accepting payments from Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania between 2018 and 2022. Panzeri has reportedly admitted to have received up to Euro 2.6 million in payments from these three governments. Panzeri was the chairperson of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights from January 2017 to July 2019 when the subcommittee took up the case of alleged human rights violations by India in J&K. It is not just European MPS. Even British politicians have been feted by Doha, who have praised Qatar’s human rights record in the parliament. The Qatargate investigations are of importance to India which is battling intense Pakistan-sponsored terrorism through infiltration of heavily-armed terrorists and drones carrying drugs and weapons to India. Investigators are focusing on how countries like Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania are making attempts to influence the European Parliament by bribing MPs. The investigations are also linking the Pakistan-Turkey nexus against India where both Camuz and Panzeri have tried to damage India’s image and undermine Indian sovereignty. Pakistan is known to fund anti-India lobbies across the world. As Abhinav Pandya, founder and CEO of the Usanas Foundation, and anti-terrorism expert says: “Kashmir has become a global industry for many. Pakistan has always been active on the global front to internationalise the Kashmir issue. It has cultivated and invested in lobbies in countries like the UK, the USA, Canada and Europe.” Pandya says that Islamabad has pumped money in civil society organisations to raise the pitch against India. “There are lots of Islamist groups working as charities and welfare organisations who have good relations with Western governments. They have been peddling a Pakistani agenda on Kashmir. Qatargate is just one of such efforts by Pakistan,” says Pandya."

If the meeting takes place, then it will be the first one between the two leaders after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year. PM Modi left for the Japanese city this morning to attend three sessions at the G7 summit as part of his three-nation tour that will also take him to Papua New Guinea and Australia. Besides attending the summit, PM Modi will also hold a serious of bilateral meetings with a number of global leaders including Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida.

During her visit, Ms Dzhaparova handed over a letter to Minister of State for External Affairs Meenakshi Lekhi. The letter was written to PM Modi by President Zelenskyy. Since the Ukraine conflict began, PM Modi spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as President Zelenskyy a number of times.

Imran Khan says Nawaz Sharif wanted better relationship with India & Israel,https://idrw.org/imran-khan-says-nawaz-sharif-wanted-better-relationship-with-india-israel/,"May 19, 2023","SOURCE: UNI In a recent development, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has made a significant claim, stating that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif requested the Pakistani army to halt its support for terrorism against India. Imran Khan’s statement sheds light on the internal dynamics within Pakistan’s political and military establishments concerning cross-border terrorism. Imran Khan’s revelation suggests that Nawaz Sharif, during his tenure as Prime Minister, urged the Pakistani army to discontinue its backing of terrorist activities directed towards India. This claim holds great significance as it indicates a potential shift in the country’s stance on cross-border terrorism. The accusation of Pakistan supporting terrorism against India has long been a bone of contention between the two nations. Imran Khan’s statement adds a new dimension to this contentious issue and highlights the complexities of Pakistan’s internal power dynamics. While the claim made by Imran Khan has not been independently verified, it underscores the evolving discourse surrounding terrorism and regional stability. If true, Nawaz Sharif’s alleged request to curtail support for terrorism marks a departure from previous policies and potentially indicates a willingness to foster peaceful relations with India. The disclosure also raises questions about the influence and authority of the Pakistani army in shaping the country’s foreign policy and security strategies. It highlights the delicate balance of power between civilian leadership and the military establishment in Pakistan. It is important to note that the relationship between India and Pakistan has been marred by decades of conflict and strained diplomatic ties. Any significant policy shift on terrorism by Pakistan could potentially pave the way for improved bilateral relations and greater regional stability."

The land on which the encroachment was removed yesterday was either allotted by UIT earlier or is in the water catchment area. That’s why we have explained to those people that if you sit at this place then you will face problems in future also,” Tina Dabi said. She further said that the land will be allotted to those who have got citizenship. “The encroachments that were removed yesterday were done during the last 10 days and were fresh. The land will be allotted to those who have got citizenship and those who have not got it will be identified and settled after getting citizenship they will also be allotted land,” she added."

Fernand de Varennes, UN special rapporteur on minority issues had objected to India holding the G20 meeting in Kashmir citing allegations of human rights violations. Calling the statement ‘irresponsible and malicious’ GKPD said, “We, representing the global diaspora of the aboriginal inhabitants of the Kashmir Valley, who once inhabited the entire Kashmir Valley from times immemorial, have been reduced to a steadily shrinking minority over the past decades, and were subsequently forced out completely from our ancestral lands in 1989 and 1990. “The rise of extremist forces changed the social, cultural and religious order of the place and we were subjected to horrific genocide resulting in our ethnic cleansing from the Valley. This is the real and the only ‘demographic change’ that has taken place in Kashmir. “Till date the so-called Independent experts and special rapporteurs on minority rights at the United Nations have remained mute spectators to our plight and there has not been a single statement of concern or support in favour of us, the real minorities of Kashmir. “Leading International Human rights organisations like Amnesty International, Asia Watch, etc., have failed to recognise the genocide perpetuated on Kashmiri Pandits. “In October 2018 we requested Honourable Antonio Guterres to hold a meeting with our team during his India trip so that we could apprise him of our side of the story.

The submarine underwent a comprehensive upgrade at the Naval Dockyard in Russia and subsequently embarked on a challenging 97-day return journey through the Norwegian Sea, English Channel, and the Mediterranean Sea before reaching Mumbai on May 16th. INS Sindhuratna faced a significant accident in February 2014, resulting in the unfortunate loss of two officers. However, the submarine had been scheduled for a “medium refit-cum-life extension” upgrade at Severodvinsk long before the Russia-Ukraine war erupted almost a year ago. Due to the ongoing conflict, transportation and logistical challenges arose, causing delays in the submarine’s return. Nevertheless, after completing the extensive refurbishment in Russia, INS Sindhuratna began its demanding voyage back to its homeport in Mumbai. The submarine’s journey encompassed treacherous waters, including the Norwegian Sea, the English Channel, and the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the challenges posed by the transport disruptions linked to the Russia-Ukraine war, INS Sindhuratna safely arrived in Mumbai. With INS Sindhuratna’s return, the Indian Navy gains a revitalized asset capable of contributing to its operational readiness and maritime security objectives. The submarine’s upgraded systems and extended lifespan will bolster India’s naval capabilities and ensure the nation’s maritime interests are effectively protected. As the submarine settles back into its operational role, the Indian Navy can leverage the advanced capabilities of INS Sindhuratna to enhance its presence and vigilance in the Indian Ocean region. The successful refit and return of the submarine serve as a testament to the Indian Navy’s dedication to maintaining a modern and potent fleet."

This development has raised concerns about the escalating military presence and its potential implications for regional stability. China’s reinforcement of its military capabilities in Tibet is seen as a strategic move to assert its dominance in the region and potentially exert pressure on India. The deployment of fighter jets and attack helicopters signifies China’s intention to enhance its offensive capabilities and project power in the border areas. The increased military presence in Tibet adds to the existing concerns about the disputed border between India and China.

The findings highlight a systematic and active engagement by China in spreading its propaganda and controlling public opinion through various online channels. Through the widespread use of social media, China aims to manipulate the discourse and narratives surrounding crucial issues affecting India. By leveraging these platforms, it seeks to mold public perception in a manner that aligns with its own interests and agenda. This includes promoting favorable narratives about China while discrediting opposing viewpoints or dissenting voices. The report emphasizes the need for Indian social media users to exercise heightened vigilance and critical thinking in order to counteract these manipulative attempts. It underscores the importance of being aware of the potential biases and agendas behind the information being shared on social media platforms. Recognizing the impact of social media as a powerful tool for shaping public opinion, China has actively employed tactics such as coordinated misinformation campaigns, strategic content distribution, and the use of fake accounts and bots to amplify its messaging. These methods are designed to create an illusion of widespread support or agreement, thus influencing public sentiment in a desired direction. The report serves as a wake-up call, urging Indian social media users to be more discerning and cautious about the information they encounter online. It encourages individuals to verify the credibility of sources, cross-check facts, and engage in critical analysis before forming opinions or sharing information with others. By fostering a culture of critical thinking and media literacy, Indian social media users can effectively challenge and counteract the narrative manipulation attempts by China. This includes actively seeking out diverse perspectives, engaging in fact-checking, and promoting open dialogue to ensure a more informed and balanced public discourse. In conclusion, the report sheds light on China’s use of social media as a powerful tool to drive the narrative in India. It calls for increased awareness, critical thinking, and media literacy among Indian social media users to guard against the manipulation of information and safeguard the integrity of public discourse."

We kept warning the government that something like this may happen… We are today in a situation similar to what the Kashmiri Pandits faced,” Nabashyam Heigrujam, president of civil society group World Meitei Council, said. “We are at the risk of ethnic cleansing in our own state,” he claimed. Heigrujam also said that they have been trying to fix a meeting with Shah for over a year now, but have not been given an appointment yet. “Meiteis and Nagas are the original people of Manipur… We wanted to submit our viewpoint to the home minister. We tried our best to speak to him for at least five minutes. We have submitted our application, but even in this time of crisis, we are very much hurt that the home minister has no time to meet us,” he added. Nabakishore Singha Yumnam, spokesperson of the World Meetei Council, said urgent action is needed on behalf of the government by providing Scheduled Tribe status to the Meiteis at par with the Nagas and Kukis. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals—Nagas and Kukis—constitute another 40 per cent of the population and reside in the hill districts. The Meitei community also demanded implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Manipur to weed out “illegal immigrants”, and cancelation of the suspension of operations (SoO) agreement signed with various Kuki militant groups. The SoO was signed by the Centre, Manipur government and two conglomerates of Kuki militant outfits – Kuki National Organisations and United Peoples Front. The pact was first signed in 2008 and extended periodically. The May 3 ethnic clashes claimed more than 70 lives and some 10,000 army and paramilitary personnel had to be deployed to bring back normalcy in the northeastern state."
"India supplied Rs 421 crore in arms, raw materials to Myanmar military since 2021 coup: UN report",https://idrw.org/india-supplied-rs-421-crore-in-arms-raw-materials-to-myanmar-military-since-2021-coup-un-report/,"May 19, 2023","SOURCE: API India has reportedly provided arms worth Rs 421 crore to the Myanmar military, a move that has drawn criticism from the United Nations (UN), which refers to it as the “death trade.” This revelation highlights the concerns raised by international bodies regarding the role of arms trade in perpetuating conflicts and human rights abuses. The supply of arms by India to the Myanmar military raises questions about the responsible and ethical use of weaponry. The UN has expressed its alarm over this transaction, as it fears that the arms provided may contribute to further violence and repression in Myanmar. The conflict in Myanmar has been characterized by widespread human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, forced displacement, and sexual violence. In this context, the provision of arms to the military raises serious concerns about their potential misuse against civilian populations and exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. The UN’s categorization of this arms supply as a “death trade” underscores the need for greater scrutiny and regulation of arms transfers. It highlights the importance of enforcing strict controls to ensure that weapons are not used to perpetrate violence or suppress human rights. Critics argue that such arms transfers undermine efforts to promote peace, stability, and democracy in Myanmar. They call for increased transparency and accountability in arms trade practices, urging governments to prioritize human rights considerations over economic and geopolitical interests. The Indian government, in response to the criticism, asserts that the arms supplied to Myanmar are intended for defensive purposes and to support the country’s legitimate security needs. However, there are concerns that the weapons may be used against ethnic minorities or to suppress democratic movements within Myanmar. The controversy surrounding India’s arms supply to Myanmar highlights the complex ethical dilemmas associated with the arms trade. It underscores the need for stricter regulations, transparency, and international cooperation to prevent the flow of weapons to regions plagued by conflict and human rights abuses. Moving forward, it is crucial for governments to reevaluate their arms export policies and prioritize human rights considerations. Efforts should be made to strengthen international frameworks and promote responsible arms trade practices to prevent the weaponization of conflicts and protect vulnerable populations."
ISRO Likely To Launch Chandrayaan 3 In Second Week Of July: Report,https://idrw.org/isro-likely-to-launch-chandrayaan-3-in-second-week-of-july-report/,"May 19, 2023","SOURCE: PTI If things go as planned, the Indian Space Research Organisation would launch its ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission aimed at demonstrating critical technologies to land the spacecraft on the south pole of the moon in less than two months. Chandrayaan-3 mission carries scientific instruments to study the thermo-physical properties of the lunar regolith, lunar seismicity, lunar surface plasma environment and elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site. “Chandrayaan-3 mission is scheduled in July second week,” a senior official of the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency under the Department of Space told PTI on Thursday. While the scope of these scientific instruments on the lander and the rover would fit in the theme of ‘Science of the Moon’, another experimental instrument would study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the Earth from the lunar orbit, which would fit in the theme of ‘Science from the Moon’, according to ISRO officials. In March this year, Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft successfully completed the essential tests that validated its capability to withstand the harsh vibration and acoustic environment that the spacecraft would face during its launch. These tests were particularly challenging, considering the fact that the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which would be launched by LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark-III) (earlier referred as GSLV Mk III) from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota, is a composite of three modules — propulsion, lander and rover. “Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration”, an ISRO official said. The propulsion module, which has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit, would carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. Lander payloads are: ‘Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment’ to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; ‘Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity’ for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; and ‘Langmuir Probe’ to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from the US space agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is also accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies. Rover payloads are: ‘Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer’ and ‘Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy’ for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site. The Lander would have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which would carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The main function of the propulsion module is to carry the lander module from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate it. Apart from this, the propulsion module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which would be operated post separation of the lander module, it was noted."

In a major victory for India’s fight in bringing perpetrators of the 26/11 attacks to justice, US Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian of the US District Court of the central district of California issued a 48-page order on May 16, saying Rana should be extradited to India. “Insofar as the question of Tahawwur Rana is concerned, we are in very regular touch with the US authorities to ensure that there is speedy and early extradition of Tahawwur Rana. We have all seen the judgement which was given by the local US court there. That conversation of ours with the US side is continuing,” Kwatra said. He was replying to a question at a media briefing on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take up the issue of Rana’s extradition to India if there is a bilateral meeting between him and US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima. Kwatra did not confirm a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Biden. “The bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the G7 summit are still being firmed up. So I am not going to make any assumptions about which meeting will happen and which will not,” he said. Prime Minister Modi will leave for Hiroshima on Friday to attend three separate sessions at the G7 summit. The ruling on Rana’s extradition came just over a month before Prime Minister Modi travels to the US on his first state visit at the invitation of Biden. The 48-page order dated May 16 was released on Wednesday. Rana, who is currently in the federal lockup in downtown Los Angeles, can appeal in the Circuit Court. There is an extradition treaty in place between India and the US. The judge ruled that Rana’s extradition to India is fully under the jurisdiction of the treaty"

PM Modi will embark on a six-day visit of Japan, Papua New Guinea and Australia on Friday to attend three key multilateral summits including that of the Group of Seven (G7) and the Quad. Prime Minister Modi’s three-nation tour will be a hectic one as over 40 engagements have been lined up, officials said, adding he will interact with over two dozen world leaders in summits as well as through bilateral meetings. In the first leg of his trip, PM Modi will visit Hiroshima from May 19 to 21 primarily for the annual summit of the G7 advanced economies in which he is expected to speak on challenges facing the globe including food, fertiliser and energy security. From Japan, PM Modi will travel to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea where he will host the third summit of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) on May 22 jointly with Prime Minister James Marape. In the third and final leg of the trip, PM Modi will visit Australia, where he will hold talks with his counterpart Anthony Albanese and address a diaspora event on May 23. The Quad summit was originally scheduled to be held in Sydney but it will now take place in Hiroshima as Biden postponed his visit to Australia to focus on crucial debt-ceiling talks in Washington. “There are several deliverables which we are expecting to come out of it and I think all that would be showcased when the four leaders meet in Hiroshima,” Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said at a media briefing without elaborating. Asked whether it will be a regular summit of the Quad at Hiroshima or just a meeting, he said “when the four Quad leaders meet, it is a Quad summit.” The foreign secretary said India’s regular participation at the G7 summits clearly points to increasing recognition that it should be a part of any serious effort to resolve global challenges including those of peace, security and development. “This is even salient in the context of our ongoing presidency of the G20 and our particular efforts to prioritise the interests and concerns of our fellow members of the global south,” he said. Japan is hosting the G7 summit in its capacity as the current chair of the powerful grouping. Modi is travelling to that country at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio. The broad agenda of the G7 summit will revolve around nuclear disarmament, economic resilience, economic security, regional issues, climate change, energy security, food and health. Mr Kwatra said India’s participation at the summit would be structured around two formal sessions on May 20 and another one on May 21. The first session would be on food, health, development and gender equality, the second one will be on climate, energy and environment while the third session would be on the theme ‘peaceful stable and prosperous world’. To a question on India’s position on the Ukraine conflict, Mr Kwatra referred to Modi’s message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that it is not an era of war during a bilateral meeting in the Uzbek city of Samarkand in September last year. PM Modi clearly said this is not an era of war and the resolution of the conflict has to be through dialogue and diplomacy, he recalled. “That is the fundamental anchor on which our political positioning and the pursuit of our economic interests and other interests is based insofar as this conflict is concerned,” he said. The foreign secretary said Modi will inaugurate a bust of Mahatma Gandhi in Hiroshima. He said the prime minister will also hold bilateral meetings with several leaders on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima. He, however, said the details of the meetings are being worked out. To a question, Mr Kwatra indicated that the prime minister may raise incidents of attacks on Indians in Australia during his talks with his Australian counterpart. Separately, officials said PM Modi will address over thousands of members of the Indian diaspora in Sydney along with Albanese. The event will have a lot of elements from culture to commerce and diaspora to diplomacy."

The Assam Riffles have also cleared roadblocks set up by various organisations on National Highway 37 and escorted truck columns carrying essential supplies to Imphal Valley. “Indian Army Patrol operating along foothills of Imphal East district recovered explosives and Remote Initiation Mechanism for IEDs in Village Bungbal Khullen on Wednesday. Three kilograms of TNT, 15 electric detonators, four circuits and remote firing devices have also been found,” the Spear Corps of the Army said. A major threat was averted by prompt action, the force said. “Area Domination and offering solace and medical assistance to people are being undertaken by multiple long duration patrols day and night by the Army and Assam Rifles columns. These patrols aptly serve as a conduit for communicating problems faced and ensuring early redressal,” the Spear Corps said. Meanwhile, the movement of trucks carrying essential commodities such as rice, sugar and pulses to Imphal Valley has resumed. The movement stopped due to roadblocks and fear among transporters after clashes broke out in Manipur after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts on May 3 to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. Following this, the stock of essential supplies in the state started dwindling and was beginning to reach critical levels. Army and Assam Rifles stepped in to assure protection to vehicles carrying essential goods from/to Imphal, a Defence spokesperson said. On May 15, a convoy of 28 vehicles including trucks, fuel tankers, and earthmovers moved under the escort of CRPF and Manipur Police from Noney to Imphal. Prophylactic domination of the area was provided by Assam Rifles to ensure safe passage to the convoy which reached Imphal safely by afternoon. In addition, monitoring was also ensured through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Around 100 vehicles were moved on May 16 and 17. Security Forces are committed to restore normalcy and the commencement of movement of the vehicles on NH 37 is another step towards normalcy in Manipur, the Defence Spokesperson said.

"Indian Air Force sends 24,000 kg of relief material for Sudan",https://idrw.org/indian-air-force-sends-24000-kg-of-relief-material-for-sudan/,"May 19, 2023","SOURCE: ANI As the efforts for providing assistance to Sudan continued, Indian Air Force sent 24,000 kg of relief material for the war-torn country. The Indian Air Force also said they might bring back approximately 150 stranded Indians. “Today, a C-17 aircraft of the #IAF got airborne for Sudan carrying 24,000 kg of relief material. On its return journey, the aircraft will bring back approximately 150 stranded Indians,” IAF said in a tweet. To help the people in Sudan, the Indian leadership has gone above and beyond the call of duty to protect its citizens in need. On the dark, an intervening night of April 27 and 28, brave Indian Air Force pilots flew blind in the face of overwhelming odds to rescue 121 stranded Indians in war-torn Sudan. In an exquisite display of unwavering valour and impeccable operational astuteness, the Indian Bravehearts, with no navigational approach aids or fuel, landed on a run-down airstrip at Wadi Sayyidna with the help of infrared sensors and night vision goggles. In a narrow time frame, with the engine still running, the commandos on board secured passengers and their luggage and accomplished what seemed like an unattainable task in a span of a few minutes. This swift and efficient operation, a part of the greater rescue operation ‘Kaveri’ to safely evacuate 3,000 Indians from Sudan, was just one example of India’s commitment to her citizens. Team India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as captain, has ensured a collective will to work to keep Indian citizens safe…both at home and abroad. “Even if you are stuck on Mars, Indian Embassy there will help you.” This tweet from India’s late former External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj in 2017 was not merely a reassuring response to a purported distress call but a display of India’s resolve to protect her citizens, no matter which corner of the world they were in. India’s actions have been consistent with her statements. India undertook a daring and massive endeavour, ‘Operation Kaveri’ to safely bring back some 3,000 stranded Indians from the conflict-ridden North-eastern African country of Sudan. Sudhir Devare, a former Indian diplomat while appreciating India’s rescue operation in Sudan told ANI that it was not an easy job because Khartoum (Sudan) is much inside and I think there was lot of violence going on. So to rescue the Indian community from there was a problem. Also, there were people spread around in the country of Sudan. So, to bring them to Port Sudan from where they could be shifted to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) for eventual evacuation to India, all that was really very tough. The mission was fraught with logistical challenges, potential acts of aggression and political and communication barriers. But the resolute emergency response teams under committed leadership in New Delhi navigated through all hurdles and successfully brought their brethren back home. An Indian rescued from Sudan said that I cannot thank the Indian government enough. The Navy (Indian) also supported us a lot and we got the best response from all sides. Another rescued Indian said that the Indian government helped us a lot. Our situation was very bad (in Sudan) and we could not understand what to do. Yet another Indian said expressed that they had lost hope to return alive from Sudan. But he is very thankful to the authorities as they had made sure that he returned home safely. Time and time again, be it safely evacuating Indian students in Ukraine during the Russia-Ukraine war, providing an immediate way out for Indians in China and other countries during the COVID-induced global lockdown, or going as far as Yemen or terrorist-held territories in Iraq to evacuate her people, India has demonstrated both her commitment towards her citizens and her capacity to confront a crisis and emerge successful. In 2015, India’s Operation Raahat, a massive two-pronged large-scale rescue mission, saved over 6,710 citizens, including over 1,962 foreign nationals from war-torn Yemen. When the deadly COVID pandemic struck the world and forced people into lockdown, the Modi government’s operation Vande Bharat, brought back over six million Indians from across the globe. Hundreds of others were safely evacuated under Operation Ganga as India sprang into action as soon as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensified. Operation Sukoon, Operation Safe Homecoming, Operation Maitri, the list goes on… India, which has become even more proactive in the last few years, has always been one of the first responders to reach out to its citizens. India spares no effort as far as shielding her people from harm’s way. From military and civil aircraft to ships and road transportation, India mobilizes every resource at its disposal for the protection of its citizens. At the heart of these successful operations, Indian leadership has demonstrated equal levels of assertiveness and responsiveness in rescuing individuals. It was the result of tireless Indian efforts that Indian national Hamid Ansari, was falsely accused and sentenced to prison by a Pakistani court. Despite diplomatic challenges with India’s arch-rival Pakistan, India secured her citizens’ release. A law-abiding country, India has approached the International Court of Justice and sought justice for another Indian national, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was falsely accused of espionage and sentenced to death by a Pakistani court. India always upholds the law while also ensuring that she utilizes all the available options in the book to ensure that her citizens are never treated unfairly and are never subjected to inconvenience or injustice overseas. While India has used dialogue and diplomacy to secure the release of individuals who inadvertently entered other countries’ territories, like with the many cases in China and Sri Lanka, she has also been assertive and forceful when the usual tactics do not work. One such example was when the Indian Air Force’s then Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was held captive by Pakistani forces. Although the details of the diplomatic talks are not available in the public domain, Pakistani leadership, which initially misled Indians about the officer’s whereabouts, later acknowledged his presence on their soil and also released him with the status of a prisoner of war. The Pakistan government realized that India is serious, and that it will escalate further. They would have lost much more in the bargain and therefore they returned Abhinandan in a way shortest possible time said Anil Trigunayat a former Indian diplomat. Such incidents showcase India’s unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of its citizens. Even in the most challenging circumstances, India has protected its people. The government says it is committed to providing all forms of assistance to every Indian, whether he is one of the 1.4 billion people residing within the country or one of the over 32 million overseas Indians living in different parts of the world. Apart from emergency assistance, India also provides her overseas citizens with legal assistance, consular services, and even financial assistance."

The successful execution of security operations during the G20 meeting will require seamless coordination among various security agencies, including the local police, paramilitary forces, and intelligence agencies. The presence of elite forces like the Black Cats and MARCOS exemplifies the collaborative effort to maintain a high level of security and order."

Tahawwur Rana Wanted Top Pak Military Honour For 26/11 Attackers: Document,https://idrw.org/tahawwur-rana-wanted-top-pak-military-honour-for-26-11-attackers-document/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Pakistani-origin terror convict Tahawwur Rana, whose extradition to India has received a green signal, was “very relaxed” in the days after the 26/11 attacks and wanted Pakistan’s highest military honour to be bestowed on the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists who carried out the carnage in Mumbai.In a major victory for India’s fight in bringing perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to justice, US Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian of the US District Court of the Central District of California issued a 48-page order Wednesday saying that Rana “should be extradited to India” under the extradition treaty between India and the US. “The Court has reviewed and considered all of the documents submitted in support of and in opposition to the Request and has considered the arguments presented at the hearing. Based on such review and consideration and for the reasons discussed herein, the Court makes the findings set forth below, and certifies to the Secretary of State of the United States the extractability of Rana on the charged offences that are the subject of the Request,” the order said. According to the details in the Certification of Extraditability and Order of Commitment about Rana’s involvement and association with a friend and LeT terrorist David Coleman Headley, on December 25, 2008, a “co-conspirator who met Rana in Dubai sent Headley an email asking “‘How’s . . . [Rana’s] reaction on what all is happening, is he terrified or relaxed?'” Headley responded the next day that Rana “‘is very relaxed'” and was trying to calm Headley down. In a September 7, 2009 conversation, Rana told Headley that the “nine Lashkar terrorists who had been killed in the Mumbai attacks “‘should be given Nishan-e-Haider,'” which is Pakistan’s highest military honour.” Rana, now 62, also asked Headley to tell “one of the co-conspirators responsible for planning the Mumbai attacks that he should get “a medal for top class.”” The document also notes that “Rana was pleased to learn Headley had already conveyed the compliment based on prior statements Rana had made equating the co-conspirator to a famous general. Rana also occasionally communicated directly with some of Headley’s contacts in Pakistan, it said. “Rana was also in direct touch with the . . . handlers for [Headley] and passed on information as and when required.” The order noted that the court cannot certify Rana’s extradition unless there is probable cause to believe he committed the offences for which extradition is sought. Citing its reasoning in detail, the order states “Accordingly, the Court finds there is probable cause to believe Rana committed the charged offences as to which extradition has been sought and should be extradited to India under the extradition Treaty between the United States and India.” India filed a complaint on June 10, 2020, seeking the provisional arrest of Rana with a view towards extradition. The Biden Administration had supported and approved the extradition of Rana to India. The order also mentions that in India, Headley conducted surveillance on Chabad Houses in Delhi, Goa, and Pushkar as well as the National Defence College (NDC), which “teaches courses for high-level Indian Army officers, colonels and up.” He kept Rana apprised of the surveillance activities. In the September 7, 2009 conversation, Headley and Rana discussed targeting the NDC, Rana told Headley that he was already aware that the NDC was a target, and “they talked about how such an attack would kill more high-ranking Indian military officials than previous wars between India and Pakistan.” Rana also set up an email account for Headley so that Headley could communicate securely with Rana, and Headley transferred a list of Chabad houses in India – including the ones he was supposed to conduct surveillance on – into the email account for security purposes.”"
Pakistan’s so-called ‘geostrategic location’ now stands as relic of bygone era: Report,https://idrw.org/pakistans-so-called-geostrategic-location-now-stands-as-relic-of-bygone-era-report/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Pakistan’s so-called ‘geostrategic location’ now stands as a relic of a bygone era despite once being considered a gateway between the West and the East, The News International reported. Pakistan has been struggling to keep pace with the shifting tides of global power and influence and Islamabad finds itself isolated from the global arena. Children in Pakistan are taught about Pakistan’s geostrategic position as Islamabad used to get an extraordinary amount of benefits by being located in this specific zone, as per the news report. As per the news report, it is history that Pakistan received dollars. The most important events that took place in the past 75 years of Pakistan’s history just happened to be passing by its locality, including the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The report said that had Pakistan not entered the West wing and remained non-aligned, the so-called ‘geostrategic location’ would be non-existent, and thus would not have entered the discourse at all. The US alliance was a big source of dollars in the presently bankrupt state for the most part of its inception. The American troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan was the last of the US’ asks for Islamabad. Since then, a sad state of affairs has prevailed for lawmakers in Islamabad, as per The News International report. Pakistan is near default and utterly clueless about what lies ahead of it. Although, Pakistan continues to remain in the same position. However, it no longer enjoys the exploits that it used to have earlier, as per the news report. The Taiwan issue and activities in the South China Sea are now of particular importance to the US. The US needs support in the region to counter the rise of China. However, Washington will not choose Pakistan for support against China due to ties between Beijing and Islamabad. For the US, India is an ideal choice to partner with amid the Chinese expansion. The ties between India and US relations are at their peak right now. The US Indo-Pacific policy has named India as its biggest strategic partner in the Indian Ocean, according to The News International report. India is projected to become the third-largest economy in a few years and is also located in the same vicinity as Pakistan. India has an outstanding foreign policy, which has been reaffirmed multiple times by the international community, as per the news report. Pakistan was once among the biggest beneficiaries of American imperialism. However, Pakistan’s policymakers did not take action beyond receiving military aid and they even did not make a plan for receiving dollars, according to The News International report. The result of neglect has resulted in the form of a crippled economy, record-high brain drain and inflation. The positional shift in US imperialism will no longer benefit Islamabad. Pakistan is struggling to receive a loan to pay off the debt. It is imperative for Pakistan to understand and redefine national interests to avoid isolation on the regional and global levels. The report called on Pakistan to mend its ties with India as New Delhi and restore trade needs as India is a burgeoning regional and global economic power."
"Pakistan heading towards imminent disaster, may face East Pakistan-like situation: Imran Khan",https://idrw.org/pakistan-heading-towards-imminent-disaster-may-face-east-pakistan-like-situation-imran-khan/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Pakistan is heading towards an imminent disaster and it may face disintegration, former prime minister Imran Khan has warned as he accused the ruling coalition of hatching a conspiracy to pit the army against his party. In a video-link address from his Zaman Park residence here on Wednesday, the 70-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief said the only solution to end political instability was to hold elections. “The PDM leaders and Nawaz Sharif, who is absconding in London, are least concerned whether the country’s constitution is desecrated, state institutions are destroyed or even Pakistan Army earns a bad name. They are looking for their vested interests of saving the looted wealth alone,” he said. “I am seeing a frightening dream that the country is heading towards an imminent disaster. I appeal to the powers that be to let the elections take place and save the country,” Khan said as police have surrounded his home. Speaking about the unrest that followed his arrest from the Islamabad High Court premises on May 9, Khan asserted that it was a “pure conspiracy” hatched and executed allegedly on behalf of the ruling coalition and the Punjab caretaker government. “This is high time that the powers that be should sensibly rethink otherwise the country might face an East Pakistan-like situation,” he was quoted as saying by Dawn newspaper. Defending his criticism of the country’s army, Khan said: “When I reprimand the army, it is like I am criticising my kids.” “I have repeatedly stated that I do not interfere in state institutions’ internal matters. I did not interfere when I had confirmed reports that the former army chief was conspiring against me,” he said, claiming some politicians were telling the current army chief that Khan would de-notify him if voted to power. Strongly reacting to the Punjab government’s claim that some 40 terrorists are hiding at his Zaman Park residence, Khan said the government must search the house in a lawful manner after obtaining a search warrant because his own life was also in danger in the presence of terrorists. “But don’t make this an excuse to launch a crackdown on the country’s largest political party PTI,” he said. Khan said a recent survey revealed that Pakistan’s 70 per cent population was standing with the PTI and the remaining 30 per cent people with all the parties that are part of the ruling coalition. Following his video-link address, Khan allowed the electronic and digital media representatives access to his residence to see for themselves that there were no terrorists inside Zaman Park. The media persons, who visited the house, later reported that there were only domestic workers and some policemen inside the house. Earlier in the day, he tweeted: “Probably my last tweet before my next arrest. Police have surrounded my house”. He also posted some videos showing police taking positions outside his house. The arrest of Khan on May 9 by the paramilitary Pakistan Rangers at the IHC premises triggered unrest in Pakistan. For the first time in Pakistan’s history, the protesters stormed the army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi and also torched a corps commander’s house in Lahore. Police put the death toll in violent clashes to 10 while Khan’s party claims 40 of its workers lost their lives in the firing by security personnel. On Monday the top military brass vowed to bring the arsonists, who attacked the civil and military installations, to justice through trial under relevant laws of the country, including the Pakistan Army Act and Official Secrets Act. Khan was ousted from power in April last year after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership, which he alleged was part of a US-led conspiracy targeting him because of his independent foreign policy decisions on Russia, China and Afghanistan."

Speaking on the commendable work done by India after it assumed the rotating presidency of the G20, George said, “India, as the chair of G20 has taken a lot of initiatives. As you know, there are more than 200 meetings scheduled to be held in India on G20 and there has been active participation from Japan in that meetings. And when it comes to India’s participation, India is here as an important partner, partner of peace, stability, security and economic progress.” Explaining the significance of holding the G7 summit specifically in Hiroshima at a time when the world is facing the Russia-Ukraine war, the envoy said, “Hiroshima is a city of peace. India is a country of peace. And our position on Ukraine Russia issue has been well articulated by our leadership on various occasions, including in the United Nations when we were a member of the UN Security Council, that India stands for peace,” “Our Prime Minister has made it clear that this is not an era of war. This is an era of peace. That continues to be our position, and we look forward to active participation in the G 7 Summit and also for other deliberations and discussions,” the Indian envoy said. The Indian ambassador also said that the Indian government is working on various initiatives to improve people-to-people between the two countries. “As you are aware, recently we have launched this India-Japan era of tourism with a focus on connecting the Himalayas with Mount Fuji. So that program is also under progress and we look forward to connecting with the community of the people to people connect of the two countries and of course the Indian diaspora in Japan,” George said. PM Modi will embark on a three-nation visit on Friday. During his six-day tour, he is scheduled to visit Japan, Papua New Guinea and Australia."

G-20 Summit in Kashmir set to give massive fillip to tourism sector,https://idrw.org/g-20-summit-in-kashmir-set-to-give-massive-fillip-to-tourism-sector/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: ANI From ensuring that 120 Smart City projects are completed on time to beefing up security, the administration in Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory (UT) is working round-the-clock to ensure that the summit in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is a huge success and promotes Kashmir as a global tourism destination. With sustainable and inclusive development initiatives taken by the Modi government, the citizens in Jammu and Kashmir believe that the event (G20 Tourism Working Group meeting) can serve as a power booster for the local economy and a progressive factor for the business community in the region to explore multidimensional growth opportunities. The tourism industry, which has played a crucial role in the development of UT. However, years of instability have impacted the tourism industry, leading to a decline in the number of visitors. Tourism players in Kashmir believe that the G20 Summit can attract investors and tourists from across the globe. “Be it a local citizen or anyone else associated with the tourism industry, everyone here in Kashmir is excited for the grand G-20 Summit. This meeting here in Srinagar is set to boost tourism. Furthermore, this meeting will provide our Jammu and Kashmir UT a platform to showcase its beauty to the entire world,” said Umar Bukhari, a local resident of Srinagar. “Things are changing for the betterment of the people here in J-K. Since the last few years we have seen the LG Manoj Sinha-led administration massively investing in development which is a positive sign,” he added. Locals apart, tourism players in the Valley also believe that due to the developmental projects, the footfall of tourists has increased in J-K which indirectly is helping the trader community and in return is also boosting the economy. “It is the first time we are seeing such a tourist season in the Valley. Hordes of tourists from various parts of the country are travelling to the Valley as the ‘Heaven on Earth’ — a sobriquet given to Kashmir — is seeing tangible signs of a return to normalcy,” Mehraj Ahmad, a tourist guide in north Kashmir’s Gulmarg said, adding that the influx of foreign delegates and participants, along with showcasing the tourist destinations, can put UT on a pedestal in terms of tourism. The Government of India is also making a significant thrust to ensure better infrastructural facilities for the region’s people and entice visitors. This has resulted in a fortuitous surge in tourist activities with better law and order, a promising security system, and maintenance of peace in addition to infrastructural and connectivity improvements. Stating that G-20 was purely a peoples’ event, Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on April 15 said the event would provide a great opportunity to push J-K’s handloom, handicraft, Pashmina, and dry fruit to international markets. “G-20 which is scheduled to be held from May 22 to May 24 in Srinagar will provide an opportunity to push J-K’s handloom, handicraft, Pashmina, dry fruit, saffron and other products to international markets. “This is a great opportunity to showcase the real potential of the Union Territory to the world. It is not administration’s event but purely a people’s one,” the J-K LG said. The G20 tourism summit would take place at a time when Kashmir is experiencing a boom in tourism and J-K draws significant investments in the tourism sector, besides medical cities, educational institutions, and other sectors. Apart from the security situations, streets and flyovers have been painted in the G20 theme colours, while new walkways are being created throughout Srinagar city in preparation for the event. Delegates from different countries will envision the valley in terms of socio-economic development. The amalgamation of international organizations and Kashmir Valley is a golden opportunity for remote areas to foster limited tourism to large-scale tourism. The meeting will openly discuss the challenges coming in the way of tourism and development. “We have seen many dark decades due to the uncertainty before 2019. After 2019 we are seeing a new world. Look at Srinagar City, it’s getting a facelift. It’s being developed like metropolitan cities in the country. People here are welcoming the initiatives like hosting of the G20 summit in Srinagar. They are aware that the G20 summit would put Kashmir on the global tourism map and would allow delegates from the most powerful countries in the world to promote J-K at different forums,” said Ashiq Naik, a journalist based in Srinagar. “People have become equal stakeholders in peace and development. They are now rejecting decades-old ‘Khandani Raaj’. They want to move ahead and prosper. They are positive that there will be a positive impact on the economy due to this summit,” he said. The UT Government and the Union Government have undertaken significant steps towards inclusion of women-led initiatives for balanced growth. India has rightly called for the inclusion of gender concerns into the core agenda of the G20 during its Presidency, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi noting that “we have to maintain priority on women-led development even in our G-20 agenda.” The summit as per the top official is expected to bring much-needed relief to the economy of Jammu and Kashmir, which has suffered a massive setback due to prolonged turmoil in the region. “Decades of instability and conflict have taken a heavy toll on the economy. The summit will inevitably inject a much-needed boost of cash into the economy, creating jobs and driving growth. It will also provide a platform for policymakers and investors to discuss and plan for the development of essential infrastructure,” the official said. He said though the summit has to majorly deal with the tourism of Jammu and Kashmir but directly or indirectly the summit will have an impact on the business community too which will trickle down the economy as well. “This is the first time such an international event is happening in the valley. The youth of J-K are eager to take this opportunity to showcase their talent and skills. They have shown active participation and commitment to ensuring that their voices are heard in the discussions. The G20 Summit in Kashmir marks a shift from the earlier days, where the region was viewed solely through the prism of violence,” the official said. The third G20 Tourism Working Group meeting will be held at Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Center (SKICC) from May 22 to 24. The first Working Group meeting was held in February at Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. The second meeting was held from April 1 to 3 in Siliguri, West Bengal. G20 comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkiye, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union. It represents 85 per cent of the global GDP, 75 per cent of international trade, and two-thirds of the world’s population. Commenting on the significance of the G20 meeting, Javed Shah, editor of the local English daily Good Morning Kashmir, highlighted the potential to promote economic development in the region. “I believe it will create more job opportunities for Kashmiris. Coming delegates from over 20 countries will send a positive message that Kashmir is a safe place for investment which will create new job opportunities for the valley youth,” he said. “Unemployment is the biggest issue here in Kashmir. These delegates from 20 countries should work as brand ambassadors for Kashmir. They should work for the promotion of tourism in their respective countries,” Javed Shah said. Like tourism players, the G20 meeting has brought smiles to artisans’ faces also, they believe and hope that the delegates from 20 countries may visit their handicraft stalls. “We have heard that they (delegates) will visit our handicraft stalls, and we hope so. With their visit, we can also interact with them, and it may help us to reach our products to the international market,” said Imitiyaz Ahmad, who is associated with craft for the last four decades. International tourist resort Gulmarg of north Kashmir’s Baramulla is also set to welcome tourism delegates from the G-20 nations in the last week of May 2023. It is worth mentioning here that the grand event will have a large impact on the history of the Baramulla district and there will be no curbs anywhere while schools, colleges and markets will remain open. The traffic on all routes will ply normally and to facilitate the foreign delegates, a proper traffic advisory will be issued in advance. The welcome boards and signages were erected in Gulmarg. The road to Gulmarg from Srinagar, the Narbal-Gulmarg stretch, is being given a new look. To enhance the aesthetic value of the existing structures, footpaths and medians have been developed, traffic roads are being furnished, hoardings are installed and government buildings and commercial building walls are being painted in the district."
"EU, India warn China against BRI projects violating sovereignty of third countries",https://idrw.org/eu-india-warn-china-against-bri-projects-violating-sovereignty-of-third-countries/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: IANS The European Union and India have now joined hands to prevent China from extending its Belt and Road Initiative connectivity projects through the territories of third countries, in gross violation of their sovereignty rights. The construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passing through the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) is a glaring example of such high-handed behaviour of Beijing. The Fourth Strategic Partnership Review Meeting between European Union and India in New Delhi on May 8, 2023, discussed the perspectives for a safer, prosperous and more democratic world. “Both sides discussed cooperation in the sphere of connectivity and emphasised that connectivity projects respect sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said a joint Press release issued after the meeting. India has repeatedly registered its protests over the CPEC, the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative of China; saying the construction of the road violates the sovereignty of India as it passes through the Gilgit-Baltistan area of PoK, an Indian territory illegally occupied by Pakistan. India protested in May, 2021, when China said it was planning to extend its CPEC to Afghanistan. China has disregarded India’s protests and sovereignty concerns. Paying scant regard to Indian interests, on May 9, 2023, Pakistan, China and Afghanistan formally agreed to extend the CPEC to Afghanistan. In fact, the visit of Foreign Minister of China Qin Gang to New Delhi and Islamabad in the first week of May is an evidence of the cynic and treacherous nature of the current Chinese leadership. In New Delhi, the Chinese Foreign Minister tried to cajole the Indian leadership to normalise the Sino-Indian relations, while forgetting the issue of illegal occupation by China of large chunks of disputed territories on the India–China border; in eastern Ladakh and other places. It is another matter that the Indian leadership has seen through the Chinese design. On May 12, addressing the Sixth edition of the Indian Ocean Conference in Dhaka, Foreign Minister of India S. Jaishankar said that one could not trust a nation that disregarded legal obligations and violated long-standing agreements. From New Delhi, however, Foreign Minister of China Qin Gang flew directly to Islamabad and at the 5th China – Afghanistan – Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue decided on extending the CPEC to Afghanistan, knowing that this move would perpetuate the illegal occupation of Indian territories in Kashmir by Pakistan. In a joint statement issued after the meeting on May 6, the three sides reaffirmed “their commitment to further trilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and to jointly extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan”. It seems, however, that the Chinese leadership has failed to read the writing on the wall that the Common people of Pakistan are not accepting the BRI projects that are not bringing any benefit for them and are wholly in the interest of China. Within days of the visit of Foreign Minister of China Qin Gang to Pakistan and the decision to extend the CPEC to Afghanistan, on May 11 Chinese nationals working in a shipyard in the port city of Karachi in Pakistan had a providential escape as a suspected suicide bomber was killed and a deadly attack on Chinese nationals was foiled by security forces. This is not the first time, however, that Chinese nationals working in BRI and other projects in Pakistan have faced lethal attacks. In April 2022, a female suicide bomber carried out an attack on a van carrying three Chinese teachers at Karachi University. Earlier in July 2021, nine Chinese engineers were killed in an explosion in a bus at Dasu hydropower plant. There have been various other attacks on Chinese nationals in Pakistan in recent months, indicating the deep resentment of the common Pakistani against the BRI projects of China. While delivering the Fullerton Lecture in Singapore in 2015, then Foreign Secretary of India S. Jaishankar (now the Indian External Affairs Minister) rejected the concept of the BRI and described it as “China’s national initiative”. He said: “If a country is going ahead with implementing a national initiative, it’s not incumbent on other countries to necessarily buy it. There would be a need for a large discussion and that hasn’t happened.” In other words, China is trying to thrust BRI projects on other countries to serve its own national interest and to the detriment of the interest of the recipient countries. The widespread perception in India is that the BRI initiative is an attempt by China to unsettle the established regional order and replace it with a China-centric system that would marginalise other Asian powers such as India and Japan. There is also the concern that countries that will host BRI projects will have to face unsustainable debt burden and ecological and environmental disorder. The experience of Sri Lanka and Pakistan with BRI projects has vindicated these concerns. Both the countries are caught in a debt trap and are now dependent on the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package. Besides, Sri Lanka has lost control over Hambantota Port to China. Now Bangladesh has expressed reservations about BRI projects. The European Union, too, has suffered because of Chinese attempts to extend BRI projects to Europe. Beijing has been successful in roping into the BRI only some of the less prosperous European nations, mostly in east Europe. A Chinese ambition to involve the G-7 nations in its questionable BRI projects has, however, predictably failed. At one stage, China signed some BRI agreements with Italy; but realising the dangers of getting caught in a debt trap and falling prey to Chinese designs to undermine the cyber security of Italy, Rome has since walked out of these projects. The EU has realised that Beijing is trying to arm-twist the European countries which have signed BRI agreements with China to get sufficient political foothold to influence policies of the EU. Like, in June 2017 Greece blocked an EU statement at the U.N. Human Rights Council criticising the human rights records of China; the first time the EU failed to make a joint statement at the top human rights body of the U.N. In March 2017, Hungary refused to sign a joint letter denouncing the reported torture of detained lawyers in China, going against an EU consensus. In July 2016, Hungary and Greece sought to block any direct reference to China in an EU statement about the ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that struck down the legal claims of Beijing in the South China Sea. President of France Emmanuel Macron in a visit to China in January 2018 echoed the concern of some EU member states about the BRI; stating there could be no “one way” trade road leading to “hegemony, which would transform the recipient countries into vassals”; thus making it clear that Beijing was using the BRI to extend its hegemony over the recipient countries of the financial assistance. In the past, other European leaders like British Prime Minister Theresa May had refused to endorse the BRI. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had warned that China’s “New Silk Road” was not being conducted “in the spirit of free trade” and that it could lead to Chinese influence in the Balkans. In the past, the EU has voiced concerns about BRI projects on issues such as lack of respect for labour, environment and human rights standards. At a Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in June 2017, European Commission Vice President Jirki Katainen stressed that the EU would only endorse the BRI if China adhered to principles such as openness, interoperability, transparency and sustainability. This position has demonstrated fairly strong EU unity, according to analysts. China does not care for the human rights records of the countries where they want to extend their BRI. That’s why BRI is so popular with the autocratic and oppressive rulers in the world. It is no wonder that Beijing has now decided to extend the BRI to Afghanistan, with the abominable human rights records of the Taliban rulers. A report from the UN Mission in Afghanistan in July 2022 has confirmed the erosion in basic human rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, “extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and violation of fundamental freedom”. Women in Afghanistan have experienced their rights of access to education, to the workplace and to participate in public life severely restricted. “Not allowing girls to go to secondary school means a generation of girls will not complete their full 12 years of basic education,” says the report. An Amnesty International report on Afghanistan in 2022 presents an equally grim picture of the human rights situation in Afghanistan. The rulers in Beijing, by extending the CPEC to Afghanistan, want to strengthen the hands of the obscurantist and oppressive Taliban rulers."

While a new Afterburner module has been designed, it is yet to undergo full-scale developmental testing. GTRE aims to secure funds for the program to showcase a fully developed engine on board an LCA-Tejas aircraft. It is important to note that work on an indigenous alternative engine for the American F404 is still pending. GTRE intends to employ this demonstration as a stepping stone to develop an enhanced Kaveri engine for a potential re-engine program. However, sources familiar with the matter have informed idrw that even with the Afterburner module, the Dry Kaveri engine will not surpass the 76kN thrust level. This falls short of the GE F404 engine, which can generate 84kN of thrust. Currently, GTRE is in the process of developing eight Dry Kaveri engines for the final certification process scheduled to take place before 2025. The organization is keen on further advancing the engine’s capabilities, aiming to achieve thrust levels of 90kN. This will be accomplished by increasing the airflow and pressure ratio without altering the length and inlet diameter of the engine, necessitating improvements in the core section to sustain higher temperatures for longer durations."

In addition, the movement of vehicles is also being monitored by drones, according to a defence spokesperson. Since May 15, around 130 vehicles carrying essential items, food grains, medicines and other vital things entered Manipur through various highways, the spokesman said. He said that during the ethnic violence in Manipur, supplies to the non-tribal Meitei community-dominated Imphal valley were cut off due to a road blockade, as well as fear amongst transporters. As a consequence, the supply of essentials in the state was dwindling and beginning to reach critical levels, the defence PRO said, adding that the Army and Assam Rifles stepped in to assure protection to vehicles carrying such goods to and from the Imphal valley and other parts of Manipur. On Monday, a convoy of 28 vehicles, including trucks, fuel tankers carrying rice, sugar, pulses and fuel, moved under the escort of CRPF and Manipur Police from Noney district to Imphal. Another set of 100 vehicles were moved on Tuesday and Wednesday. Prophylactic domination of the area was provided by the Assam Rifles to ensure safe passage to the convoy which reached Imphal valley safely by afternoon. Security Forces remain committed to restore normalcy and the commencement of movement of the vehicles on the Imphal-Dimapur National Highway (NH37) is another step towards it, the defence sources added. The ethnic violence in Manipur since May 3 claimed the lives of 73 people and injured 250 others, while 1,800 houses were destroyed, while a large number of government and private properties were also damaged."

IRF and SFC to be in charge of India’s Nuclear and Non-Nuclear Missiles,https://idrw.org/irf-and-sfc-to-be-in-charge-of-indias-nuclear-and-non-nuclear-missiles/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. The Indian Armed Forces are set to establish the Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), which will serve as the fourth main division of the military. Functioning as a separate entity but under the authority of the Ministry of Defence, the IRF will play a crucial role as the primary defence wall of India. Equipped with a range of advanced weaponry, including surface-to-surface Pralay tactical missiles, subsonic LR-LACMs (Long Range Land Attack Cruise Missiles), BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Pinaka multi-barrel rocket systems, and other stand-off weapons, the IRF will enhance India’s defensive capabilities. The creation of the IRF reflects India’s commitment to strengthening its defence infrastructure and readiness. By incorporating advanced missile systems into the IRF’s arsenal, the Indian Armed Forces aim to enhance their ability to counter potential threats and safeguard the nation’s security. These sophisticated weapons will provide the IRF with the capability to strike targets accurately and swiftly, thereby deterring any potential aggressors. It is worth noting that the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) was established in 2003 and has been responsible for the management and administration of India’s tactical and strategic nuclear weapons stockpile. The SFC will retain its role in overseeing India’s ballistic missile arsenals, ranging from Agni-I to Agni-V. Additionally, it will continue to oversee the operation of nuclear-tipped submarine-launched ballistic missiles like the K-15 and K-4. The establishment of the IRF will complement the existing capabilities of the SFC, allowing for a comprehensive and robust defence strategy. While the SFC focuses on nuclear deterrence and strategic missile systems, the IRF will concentrate on conventional missile systems for tactical operations. This clear division of responsibilities will ensure efficient command and control structures within the Indian Armed Forces. The IRF’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, including the Pralay tactical missiles, LR-LACMs, BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, and Pinaka multi-barrel rocket systems, will significantly bolster India’s defence capabilities. The Pralay missiles, with their surface-to-surface capabilities, will provide the IRF with enhanced precision and firepower, enabling swift and accurate strikes against potential threats.

US “Very Keen” To Transfer Nuclear Energy Technology To India: Official,https://idrw.org/us-very-keen-to-transfer-nuclear-energy-technology-to-india-official/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The US is “very keen” to collaborate with India in the area of technology transfer on the nuclear energy front, a senior government official said on Wednesday. Responding to a question on how G-20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant’s request for “unfettered access” to US technology made to delegates attending the third meeting of the G-20 energy transition working group on Tuesday was taken by American delegates, Union Power Secretary Alok Kumar hinted Washington is positive. “US delegation was also there as part of the G20 group and they supported the technology transfer. But It is always on the voluntary, mutually agreed basis,” Kumar told reporters at a press conference organised at the conclusion of the three-day meet in the financial capital. Details will have to be worked out and have to be mutually agreed, he added. “My sense is the US side is very keen to collaborate with India in the area of technology…including nuclear technology,” Mr Kumar said. Addressing a side meeting of the working group on small modular reactors and the potential they present, Kant had made the request to the Americans and said that the transfer of the technology will help India produce smaller nuclear power plants, commission capacity quickly and can also eventually be exported. Mr Kumar told reporters that the Department of Atomic Energy scientists are already working on developing the SMR technology indigenously as well. The Power Ministry, which is steering the negotiations on the energy transition working group at G-20 as part of India’s presidency of the grouping, said there is a broad consensus on all the suggestions made by India to the delegates. It is only the details on how to go ahead and the exact path to be adopted on which there are some differences, Mr Kumar said, adding that the group will continue deliberations remotely on every part of the resolution in the run-up to its fourth meet in Goa in July ahead of the ministerial meeting. India has been notably able to convince the grouping for giving priority to the fuels of the future, which include green hydrogen and biofuels, Mr Kumar said. The exact nomenclature – whether to call it green hydrogen or clean hydrogen – is yet to be decided, said Kumar, who had earlier flagged the differences in opinion on whether to consider hydrogen derived from nuclear energy as “green hydrogen” or not. On the bio-fuels front, countries have agreed to include it in the fuels of the future list provided it does not hamper food security, Mr Kumar said, adding that other nations like Brazil and Indonesia have already achieved a very high amount of blending. Mr Kumar said most waste and residues will help create biofuels, and this aspect has the potential to enhance farmer incomes and create jobs as well."

Judge Jacqueline Chooljian of US District Court in Central District of Los Angeles in the order dated May 16 said that based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that 62-year-old Rana is extraditable for the offences for which extradition has been requested and on which the United States is proceeding. India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing into his role in the 26/11 attacks carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists in 2008. He was arrested in the US on an extradition request by India for his role in these attacks. The NIA has said that it is ready to initiate proceedings to bring him to India through diplomatic channels. During the court hearings, federal prosecutors have argued that Rana was aware that his childhood friend Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley was involved with Lashkar-e-Taiba and that by assisting Headley and affording him cover for his activities, he was supporting the terrorist organisation and its associates. Rana knew of Headley’s meetings, what was discussed, and the planning of the attacks, including some of the targets. The US government asserted that Rana was part of the conspiracy and there is probable cause that he committed the substantive crime of commissioning a terrorist act. Rana’s attorney, on the other hand, opposed the extradition. A total of 166 people, including six Americans, were killed in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 10 Pakistani terrorists laid a more than 60-hour siege, attacking and killing people at iconic and vital locations of Mumbai."

ISRO Pursues 100-tonne LOx Methane Engine after Successful 20-tonne Technology Demonstrator,https://idrw.org/isro-pursues-100-tonne-lox-methane-engine-after-successful-20-tonne-technology-demonstrator/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE: API ISRO, the Indian Space Research Organisation, is currently engaged in an ambitious project to develop a powerful 100-tonne LOx Methane engine. This endeavor comes on the heels of their successful demonstration of a 20-tonne technology demonstrator using LOx Methane engines. The propulsion system employs a combination of liquid oxygen as the oxidizer and methane as the fuel, which can be synthesized using resources available in space, such as water and carbon dioxide. This remarkable capability makes LOx Methane a highly sought-after space fuel, often hailed as the fuel of the future. Taking charge of this significant program is ISRO’s prestigious Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre located in Trivandrum, Kerala. The centre has been at the forefront of India’s liquid propulsion technology development for space missions. With its expertise and dedication, the centre is spearheading the efforts to propel ISRO into the realm of LOx Methane-powered engines. The shift towards LOx Methane as a propulsion fuel is a global trend, and ISRO’s advancements in this field are highly regarded by the international space community. The inherent properties of methane provide several advantages over conventional fuels like kerosene. One key advantage is that methane prevents the formation of deposits in the engine, a phenomenon commonly referred to as coking. This attribute helps to maintain the engine’s efficiency and prolong its operational life. Additionally, methane exhibits superior performance characteristics, enabling cost optimization and enhancing the overall affordability of space missions. The development of the 100-tonne LOx Methane engine aligns with ISRO’s future plans, particularly the Next-Gen Launch Vehicle (NGLV) program. The NGLV aims to design and deploy a cost-efficient reusable rocket capable of carrying substantial payloads. Specifically, the NGLV is projected to transport a payload of 10 tonnes to the Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) or up to 20 tonnes to the low Earth orbit (LEO). This significant leap in payload capacity will facilitate a wide range of missions, including communication satellite deployments, interplanetary probes, and lunar missions. The timeline for the first launch of the NGLV, incorporating the powerful LOx Methane engine, is tentatively set for 2030. This gives ISRO ample time to perfect the engine’s design, conduct extensive testing, and ensure its reliability for space applications. The successful integration of the 100-tonne LOx Methane engine into the NGLV will mark a remarkable milestone for ISRO and position India as a prominent player in advanced propulsion technologies. As ISRO continues its relentless pursuit of space exploration and technological innovation, the development of the LOx Methane engine represents a significant step forward in enhancing the country’s space capabilities. With its potential to revolutionize space propulsion systems, this engine holds tremendous promise for future missions, driving exploration deeper into space while making space travel more accessible and cost-effective."

India EU agree to coordinate policies in strategic semiconductor sector,https://idrw.org/india-eu-agree-to-coordinate-policies-in-strategic-semiconductor-sector/,"May 18, 2023","SOURCE: PTI India and the European Union have agreed to coordinate their policies in the strategic semiconductor sector with an aim to conclude an agreement by September in the first ministerial meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) in Brussels. A day after the high-level meeting, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said there was an exchange of views on issues of significance like economic security and promoting connectivity projects in third geographies, including agreeing to identify projects for joint implementation. In another significant decision, India and the EU also agreed to enhance cooperation on IT and telecoms standardisation, with a particular focus on promoting interoperable standards. Both sides had in-depth discussions on a range of issues including semiconductors, high-performance computing, digital public infrastructures, clean energy technologies and supply chain resilience, it said. The meeting was co-chaired on the Indian side by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Communications and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. It was co-chaired on the European side by executive vice presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager. “The two sides will coordinate their policies with regards to the strategic semiconductor sector, with the aim of concluding a Memorandum of Understanding by September 2023,” an India-EU joint statement said. “Furthermore, India and the European Union will work towards bridging the digital skills gap, explore mutual recognition of certifications and make progress on the promotion of skilled professionals and exchange of talent,” it said. “Both sides also agreed to enhance cooperation on IT and telecoms standardisation with a particular focus on promoting interoperable standards,” the statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had agreed to set up the TTC to facilitate the exchange of critical technologies relating to an array of domains including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors and cybersecurity. The joint statement said both sides recognise the importance of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for the development of open and inclusive digital economies and digital societies and realise that the DPI approach leverages technology, markets and governance. “To that end, India and the European Union have agreed to collaborate on enhancing the interoperability of their respective digital public infrastructures and, on this basis, jointly promote secure, privacy-preserving solutions to the benefit of developing countries,” it said. In addition, “there is an opportunity for both sides to work together on areas such as platforms, data governance and telecoms regulation,” it added. India and the European Union have set ambitious goals of achieving net zero emissions by 2070 and 2050 respectively. They have also made commitments to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and to promote a circular economy. Achieving these targets and objectives will require significant investments in new clean technologies as well as increased research and innovation efforts, the joint statement said. To this end, the working group on green and clean energy technologies will focus on relevant aspects of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, batteries for electrical vehicles and standards, it said. Jaishankar, Goyal and Vaishnaw also jointly met Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium. “The meeting saw extensive discussions on various issues, including India’s ongoing Presidency of G20, the upcoming Belgium Presidency of the Council of European Union, progress in the India-EU FTA negotiations and other regional and global issues of bilateral interest,” the MEA said. The three ministers also jointly met President of the European Commission von der Leyen and had comprehensive discussions on India–EU bilateral issues covering trade, economy, security, and strategic issues. “They agreed to make the TTC a platform to guide the relationship to face new geopolitical challenges and de-risk the global economy. They discussed the need to work together for the successful conclusion of India’s G-20 Presidency,” the MEA said."
Ukraine War comes as boon to Indian drone Startups,https://idrw.org/ukraine-war-comes-as-boon-to-indian-drone-startups/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE: API A recent report highlights the increased procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones by the Indian armed forces. The ongoing border standoff with China has further fueled this trend, prompting the Army to order nearly 2000 drones to bolster surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities along the India-China border and facilitate supply transportation to forward posts. Additionally, the Army aims to utilize drones for directing artillery fire, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of its border artillery systems. Recognizing the significance of drones as force multipliers, the Indian armed forces intend to acquire more drones in the coming years for a wide range of applications. This presents an opportunity to develop India’s military drone ecosystem. While the country’s drone start-ups have been instrumental in driving growth in the civilian drone sector, some of them also manufacture military drones, including dual-use models that fulfill both civilian and military requirements. Start-ups like ideaForge, Raphe mPhibr, and NewSpace Research & Technologies have already received orders from the Indian Army for surveillance, cargo transport, and offensive swarm drone systems. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) supports the military drone ecosystem through initiatives like Innovations For Defence Excellence (iDEX), which provides grants to develop military-grade products, including drones. The government should consider expanding iDEX challenges specifically related to UAVs and provide adequate financial assistance to enable defense start-ups to scale up drone production. Other armed forces’ initiatives like the Mehar Baba Competition by the Indian Air Force and the Him Drone-a-thon program by the Indian Army, in collaboration with the Drone Federation of India, have also contributed to the development of the military drone ecosystem. While progress has been made in establishing an environment conducive to the development and manufacture of military-grade drones, certain challenges remain. The Indian private sector currently relies on imports for key drone components due to a lack of domestic manufacturing capabilities. The government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme aims to incentivize indigenous component production but requires a larger outlay to support more start-ups. To foster a truly indigenous drone industry, India needs to build a supportive ecosystem that facilitates the supply of indigenously produced components. Another challenge is the limited research and development (R&D) undertaken by drone start-ups. Insufficient capital and uncertainty surrounding procurement orders hinder R&D efforts. To encourage R&D, the armed forces should assure start-ups of orders upon successful product development. Additionally, the armed forces should streamline their requirements, ensuring they balance advanced features with cost considerations. Overall, the demand for military-grade drones is projected to increase, creating an opportunity for India to become a leading producer of defense equipment. With the global market for military drones forecasted to grow substantially, India can leverage its talent pool and IT expertise to capture a significant share. However, adequate support must be provided to Indian drone start-ups to realize this potential."
Planned Army withdrawal from J-K shelved ‘indefinitely’,https://idrw.org/planned-army-withdrawal-from-j-k-shelved-indefinitely/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The planned phased withdrawal of the Army from certain areas of the Jammu region has been shelved “indefinitely” in view of terror attacks being orchestrated from across the border, officials said here. They said the government had planned to reduce the footprints of Rashtriya Rifles, a counter-insurgency force of the Army, in the Jammu region and hand over the security to the Jammu and Kashmir Police and paramilitary forces. The Army has three Counter-Insurgent Forces (CIF) in the Jammu region — Delta Force (which looks after the Doda region), Romeo Force (looking after Rajouri and Poonch areas) and Uniform Force (looking after Udhampur and Banihal areas). Some units of the Army had planned to gradually hand over the security and law and order management to the local police and paramilitary units in South of Pir Panjal (Jammu region), the officials said. However, keeping the situation in mind, especially the killings by terrorists this year, it has been decided to shelve the proposal “indefinitely”, the officials said. The areas in the Jammu region have seen 17 killings by terrorists, including that of 10 Army personnel. Seven civilians were killed in Dhangri village of Rajouri on January 1 this year. Of them, five civilians were killed in a terrorist firing on January 1 evening while two minors lost their lives when an IED, left behind by the terrorists before fleeing, exploded the next day. Five Army personnel were killed in cold blood when terrorists attacked their vehicle at Bhatta Durrian in Mendhar tehsil of Poonch district on April 20. The Army personnel were on their way to distribute ‘Iftar’ material to a nearby village during Ramzan. Five para commandos were killed and a Major-rank officer injured when terrorists set off an IED in Kandi forest, Rajouri on May 5. The proposal to withdraw the Army from the hinterland was under discussion for some time and a final recommendation was to be taken at the Unified Headquarters (UHQ) headed by Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha. The UHQ has top representatives from the Army, police and paramilitary forces. Post abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, the law and order and terror-related incidents had shown a decline with the number of stone pelting incidents reduced to zero."
Leh airport Resumes operations after C-17 moved from Runway,https://idrw.org/leh-airport-resumes-operations-after-c-17-moved-from-runway/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE: API Leh Airport, located in the Ladakh region of India, experienced a temporary closure on May 16th as a result of technical problems encountered by the Indian Air Force’s C-17 Globemaster aircraft. The runway blockage caused disruptions in flight operations, leading to diversions and cancellations of several domestic flights to and from Leh. The incident involved one of the 11 C-17 heavy lifters in the Indian Air Force’s fleet. The aircraft was engaged in a routine maintenance sortie when it encountered the technical issue upon landing at Leh. However, officials familiar with the matter have clarified that the problem is not severe and is being promptly addressed. The C-17 Globemaster, along with IL-76s, C-130Js, and AN-32s, plays a critical role in supporting the Indian Army’s deployments in the Ladakh region. During the tense border standoff with China in 2020, C-17s played a vital role in swiftly transporting soldiers and military equipment to the eastern Ladakh area. Leh Airport serves as a crucial airbase for the Indian armed forces, particularly in the strategic Ladakh region. It facilitates the rapid deployment of troops and the transportation of essential supplies to the forward areas. The airport’s closure due to the technical issue had an immediate impact on flight operations, causing inconvenience to passengers and logistical challenges for airlines. However, authorities have assured that the technical problem with the C-17 aircraft is being resolved, and efforts are underway to make the runway operational again. It is expected that normal flight operations will resume promptly, ensuring the smooth movement of passengers and cargo to and from Leh."

The first interdiction took place just after midnight in Ramkot village of Amritsar when the troops heard the sound of a drone and subsequent dropping of payload on the ground. Troops fired in the air to down the flying machine and simultaneously rushed to the spot where they saw three people trying to pick the consignment. The troops asked them to stop and fired at them but they managed to escape leaving behind five packets containing suspected heroin, a BSF spokesperson said. The second incident took place around 1:20 am in Kakkar village of the same district when a “rogue” drone from Pakistan violated Indian airspace. The personnel fired in the air to shoot down the drone and a search of the area led to the recovery of five packets containing suspected heroin, the spokesperson said. The total amount of heroin recovered in these two incidents is about 15.5 kg, he said. Punjab shares an over 500 km-long front with Pakistan that is guarded by the BSF and drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) taking flight from that country into India with drugs and arms and ammunition payloads have become a matter of concern for security agencies over the last three-four years."

The Northern Railway has revealed plans to begin work on the 50-km Baramulla-Uri railway line for which tenders have been floated, officials said on Tuesday, adding that the rail authorities were gearing up to undertake the Final Location Survey (FLS). They said the survey would be completed within three months of awarding the tenders. The extension of the railway line from Baramulla to Uri is expected to improve connectivity to Baramulla, Srinagar and Banihal. Locals have welcomed the move to provide railway connectivity to the border town which is 102 km from Srinagar. “We thank the L-G and Union Railway Minister for the announcement of a 50-km railway line to Uri. People will benefit a lot from it,” Mir Mushtaq, a local BJP leader, said. He said the railway line would help in providing employment opportunities to the locals. “This is a welcome step. It will give a fillip to the trade and business sector and will also boost the tourism sector,” Mohammad Shafi, a trade leader, said. “Business will get a boost with more people visiting the place. It will become easier to travel to Uri from any part of the country,” Shafi said, adding the railway line will provide seamless connectivity to the rest of the country and act as an alternate route to the national highway which remains cut off many times during a year. The railway line would also be important from a strategic point of view for the transportation of troops, equipment and other supplies to forward areas of the Line of Control. Earlier this year, the Indian Army allowed tourists to visit the Kaman Aman Setu Bridge, which connects the Kashmir Valley to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).

Indian leadership goes above and beyond call of duty to protect its citizens in need,https://idrw.org/indian-leadership-goes-above-and-beyond-call-of-duty-to-protect-its-citizens-in-need/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The Indian leadership has gone above and beyond the call of duty to protect its citizens in need. On the dark, intervening night of April 27 and 28, brave Indian Air Force pilots flew blind in the face of overwhelming odds to rescue 121 stranded Indians in war-torn Sudan. In an exquisite display of unwavering valour and impeccable operational astuteness, the Indian bravehearts, with no navigational approach aids or fuel, landed on a run-down airstrip at Wadi Sayyidna with the help of infrared sensors and night vision goggles. In a narrow time frame, with the engine still running, the commandos on board secured passengers and their luggage and accomplished what seemed like an unattainable task in a span of a few minutes. This swift and efficient operation, a part of the greater rescue operation ‘Kaveri’ to safely evacuate 3,000 Indians from Sudan, was just one example of India’s commitment to her citizens. Team India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as captain, has ensured a collective will to work to keep Indian citizens safe…both at home and abroad. “Even if you are stuck on the Mars, Indian Embassy there will help you.” This tweet from India’s late former External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj in 2017 was not merely a reassuring response to a purported distress-call but a display of India’s resolve to protect her citizens, no matter which corner of the world they were in. India’s actions have been consistent with her statements. India undertook a daring and massive endeavour, ‘Operation Kaveri’ to safely bring back some 3,000 stranded Indians from the conflict-ridden North-eastern African country of Sudan. Sudhir Devare, a former Indian diplomat while appreciating India’s rescue operation in Sudan told ANI that it was not an easy job because Khartoum (Sudan) is much inside and I think there was lot of violence going on. So to rescue Indian community from there was a problem. Also, there were people spread around in the country of Sudan. So, to bring them to Port Sudan from where they could be shifted to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) for eventual evacuation to India, all that was really very tough. The mission was fraught with logistical challenges, potential acts of aggression and political and communication barriers. But the resolute emergency response teams under committed leadership in New Delhi navigated through all hurdles and successfully brought their brethren back home. An Indian rescued from Sudan said that I cannot thank the Indian government enough. The Navy (Indian) also supported us a lot and we got the best response from all sides. Another rescued Indian said that the Indian government helped us a lot. Our situation was very bad (in Sudan) and we could not understand what to do. Yet another Indian said expressed that they had lost hope to return alive from Sudan. But he is very thankful to the authorities as they had made sure that he returned home safe. Time and time again, be it safely evacuating Indian students in Ukraine during the Russia-Ukraine war, providing an immediate way out for Indians in China and other countries during the COVID-induced global lockdown, or going as far as Yemen or terrorist-held territories in Iraq to evacuate her people, India has demonstrated both her commitment towards her citizens and her capacity to confront a crisis and emerge successful. In 2015, India’s Operation Raahat, a massive two-pronged large-scale rescue mission, saved over 6,710 citizens, including over 1,962 foreign nationals from war-torn Yemen. When the deadly COVID pandemic struck the world and forced people into lockdown, the Modi government’s operation Vande Bharat, brought back over six million Indians from across the globe. Hundreds of others were safely evacuated under Operation Ganga as India sprang into action as soon as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensified. Operation Sukoon, Operation Safe Homecoming, Operation Maitri, the list goes on… India, which has become even more proactive in the last few years, has always been one of the first responders to reach out to her citizens. India spares no effort as far as shielding her people from harm’s way. From military and civil aircrafts, to ships and road transportation, India mobilizes every resource at its disposal for the protection of her citizens. At the heart of these successful operations, Indian leadership has demonstrated equal levels of assertiveness and responsiveness in rescuing individuals. It was the result of tireless Indian efforts that Indian national Hamid Ansari, who was falsely accused and sentenced to prison by a Pakistani court. Despite diplomatic challenges with India’s arch-rival Pakistan, India secured her citizens’ release. A law-abiding country, India has approached the International Court of Justice and sought justice for another Indian national, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was falsely accused of espionage and sentenced to death by a Pakistani court. India always upholds the law while also ensuring that she utilizes all the available options in the book to ensure that her citizens are never treated unfairly and are never subjected to inconvenience or injustice overseas. While India has used dialogue and diplomacy to secure the release of individuals who inadvertently entered other countries’ territories, like with the many cases in China and Sri Lanka, she has also been assertive and forceful when the usual tactics do not work. One such example was when the Indian Air Force’s then Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was held captive by Pakistani forces. Although the details of the diplomatic talks are not available in the public domain, Pakistani leadership, which initially misled Indians about the officer’s whereabouts, later acknowledged his presence on their soil and also released him with the status of a prisoner of war. The Pakistan government realized that India is serious, that it will escalate further. They would have lost much more in the bargain and therefore they returned Abhinandan in a way shortest possible time said Anil Trigunayat a former Indian diplomat. Such incidents showcase India’s unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of her citizens. Even in the most challenging circumstances, India has protected her people. The government says it is committed to providing all forms of assistance to every Indian, whether he is one of the 1.4 billion people residing within the country or one of the over 32 million overseas Indians living in different parts of the world. Apart from emergency assistance, India also provides her overseas citizens with legal assistance, consular services, and even financial assistance."

We’ll make further announcements about that, but Prime Minister Modi would certainly be a very welcome guest here next week,” he said. “Prime Minister Kishida, of course, we had bilateral meetings at the end of last year, just a few months ago, in Perth that was very successful,” he added. Albanese termed the relationship with Japan “very important”. He also recalled receiving the “warmest of welcomes by Prime Minister Modi in India in March.” A Ministry of External Affairs release earlier said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will embark on a three-nation tour during which he will take part in G-7 Summit in Japan and the Quad Leaders’ Summit in Australia. The Prime Minister will visit Hiroshima in Japan from May 19 to 21 for the G-7 Summit under the Japanese Presidency. He is visiting Japan at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Prime Minister Modi will have bilateral engagements in Papua New Guinea, including meetings with Governor-General Sir Bob Dadae and Prime Minister James Marape. PM Modi will then visit Sydney from May 22 to 24 to participate in the Quad Leaders’ Summit, the external affairs ministry said. From Japan, the Prime Minister will travel to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, where he will host the third Summit of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC III Summit) jointly with Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape on May 22. Meanwhile, earlier in an interview with ABC News responding to a question regarding the Quad meeting Australian PM Albanese said, “No, just the US President’s visit is postponed. So that will occur at some time in the future. We will be talking with our partners about the Quad meeting over the next day.” In the interview on ABC Sydney Breakfast with James Valentine, Albanese said that the meeting with a US representative at a senior level could take place. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Australia and he has a bilateral program. Quad meeting is scheduled to take place on May 24. Responding to the question whether the meeting could still occur in Sydney with India and Japan, Albanese said, “Yes that’s right, and with a representative of the United States at a senior level, as well, could occur. Prime Minister Modi has a bilateral program that is organised so I’m certain that he will be here. And, of course, we have a very large growing diaspora here in Australia and there are events including a large event at Kudos Arena to be held next Tuesday night.” In response to a question about a meeting between four Quad leaders in Japan, Anthony Albanese said, “Yes, there, he will try to convene a meeting given that all four leaders will be in Japan over the weekend, as well. So we will have a bilateral discussion. But we’ll also hopefully be able to find a time when the four of us can can sit down. We will have to organise the logistics of the Quad meeting now in in Sydney and we’ll be discussing with our partners in the US, but also Japan and India over the over the next day or so.” Asked about when he heard about Biden’s postponing his visit to Australia, Albanese said that he spoke to Biden before 6 am this morning. He said that they have an issue regarding the potential hold-up of the budget in their parliamentary process that the US will have in the Congress and the Senate. Albanese said that the deadline for resolving the impasse regarding the debt ceiling is June 1 and Biden told him that the week before June 1 will be “critical” and that he will be postponing his trip to Australia. He said that Biden has confirmed his invitation to the US for a state visit later this year. Australian PM said that he and Biden will have a bilateral meeting in Hiroshima. White House earlier today announced that President Joe Biden had cancelled his planned trip to Australia and Papua New Guinea. However, Biden will attend the Group of Seven (G7) Summit in Hiroshima, Japan this week. “President Biden will return to the United States on Sunday, following the completion of the G7 summit, in order to be back for meetings with Congressional leaders to ensure that Congress takes action by the deadline to avert default. The President spoke to Prime Minister Albanese earlier today to inform him that he will be postponing his trip to Australia. He also invited the Prime Minister for an official state visit at a time to be agreed by the teams. The President’s team engaged with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea’s team to inform them as well,” a statement by White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, read. “We look forward to finding other ways to engage with Australia, the Quad, Papua New Guinea and the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in the coming year,” the statement added."

The Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) insisted on interest in establishing local assembly facilities for engines and manufacturing key parts within the country. This move aims to stabilize the production systems and ensure a steady supply of frequently replaced components, ultimately reducing operating costs while enhancing the combat readiness of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Officials familiar with the matter told idrw that, the local manufacturing facilities and infrastructure will play a vital role in bolstering the Tejas mk2 fleet once it enters production. The initiative is seen as a significant step towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers. GE Aviation, a leading global aircraft engine manufacturer, has expressed its intent to establish local manufacturing capabilities for F414 engines in India. The company has submitted its proposal and is now awaiting final approval from the Biden administration, which is expected to coincide with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming state visit to the United States. The decision to focus on local manufacturing aligns with the broader vision of the Indian government’s Make in India campaign, which aims to promote indigenous production and boost the domestic defence industry. By encouraging local assembly and manufacturing, the MoD seeks to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that can support the production needs of the IAF and other branches of the armed forces. The move is expected to have a positive impact on the Tejas mk2 program, which is the upgraded version of India’s indigenous Tejas fighter aircraft. The enhanced local manufacturing capabilities will provide a strong foundation for the Tejas mk2 fleet, ensuring a reliable supply chain, efficient maintenance processes, and cost-effective operations."

EU urged to crack down on imports of Indian fuels made with Russian oil,https://idrw.org/eu-urged-to-crack-down-on-imports-of-indian-fuels-made-with-russian-oil/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE : IANS The European Union (EU) should crack down on India reselling Russian oil as refined fuels including diesel into Europe, the blocs chief diplomat has said, as western nations move to tighten sanctions on Moscows energy sector, the media reported. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, told The Financial Times that Brussels was aware that Indian refiners were buying large volumes of Russian crude oil before processing it into fuels for sale in Europe, saying for the first time the EU should act to stop it. “If diesel or gasoline is entering Europe?.?.?.?coming from India and being produced with Russian oil, that is certainly a circumvention of sanctions and member states have to take measures,” Borrell said. India has become one of the biggest buyers of Russian crude oil since the invasion of Ukraine, with its refiners earning large margins by buying heavily discounted crude that is now largely barred from the EU, before selling full-priced fuels into Europe, The Financial Times reported. The trade is legal under EU sanctions but has been criticised by those who want to see harsher sanctions imposed on Russia and argue that it has allowed Moscow to keep earning large revenues from its oil sales — the biggest component in the Kremlin’s budget. Borrell acknowledged that the G7 price cap — which aims to limit Russian crude oil sales to other countries to $60 a barrel — had helped cut Russia’s oil revenues, and said it was understandable India wanted to take advantage of cheaper crude. But the top EU official suggested he was uncomfortable that much of that oil was now flowing back to Europe in the form of refined fuels, The Financial Times reported. “That India buys Russian oil, it’s normal. And if, thanks to our limitations on the price of oil, India can buy this oil much cheaper, well the less money Russia gets, the better,” Borrell said. “But if they use that in order to be a centre where Russian oil is being refined and by-products are being sold to us? We have to act.” Borrell’s comments come ahead of a meeting on Tuesday with India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, where he will raise the issue, he said."

“Have legitimacy to serve…looking forward to India’s response”: Afghan Envoy on appointment of Charge d’Affaires by Taliban,https://idrw.org/have-legitimacy-to-servelooking-forward-to-indias-response-afghan-envoy-on-appointment-of-charge-daffaires-by-taliban/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE : ANI Outright rejecting the claims from the Taliban that they have appointed the Charge d’Affaires to replace him as the head of the mission in India, Afghanistan’s envoy Farid Mamumdzay said that he was appointed by a legitimately elected government and has the legitimacy to serve here. Stressing that he is Afghanistan’s legitimate representative, Mamumdzay said that he has shared his concerns with the Indian government and is awaiting a response. The Afghan embassy in India on Monday said there is no change in its leadership following reports that the Taliban have appointed a charge d’affaires to head the mission replacing incumbent Farid Mamundzay. “We categorically rejected the claims from the Taliban that they have appointed the Charge d’Affaires at the mission. The embassy operates as normal as it did in the past. There has been an individual working at our mission who defected to the Taliban sadly and who pledged allegiance to the Taliban movement. I got to know about this on April 25. So, this episode has been weighing on since the last three weeks while I was travelling outside India and as soon as I get to know, I returned back to the mission”, the Afghan envoy told ANI in an exclusive interview. Mamundzay was appointed by the previous Ashraf Ghani government and he has been operating as the Afghan envoy even after the Taliban seized power in August 2021. When asked what can be the motive behind the Taliban in doing so, the Envoy said that as it carries no legitimacy, it is their way of making wider contacts within the “international community”. “Taliban carries no legitimacy, either in Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world. No government has recognized their regime so far. And India has consistently taken that principle position by not extending any recognition to the Taliban. The motive behind taking over our mission in such a manner is to increase their contacts with the wider international community”, said the Envoy. “Taliban feel internationally alienated and isolated from the wider world, which is something that they have done at themselves. They need to form an inclusive government and begin to respect the rule of law, Extend the required services and liberty to the people of Afghanistan, particularly by treating women and girls as they deserve. I’m sure the people of Afghanistan wouldn’t grant them legitimacy,” he added. Speaking further about Qadir Shah who has been appointed by the Taliban as the envoy for the mission in India, the envoy said that he wasn’t an accredited diplomat and that he collaborated and worked closely without his or his staff’s knowledge with the Taliban and revolted against the mission breaking all those diplomatic norms and standards. “This particular individual has been working at the mission for the past two years and three months. He was not an accredited diplomat from Kabul. His accreditation was done here, sometime back, he worked as an administrative staff, appointed from Kabul in the rank of a local staff here. So, he was not in the Ministry of foreign affairs records, he has never been a diplomat. He was promoted to being a diplomat on April 25, 2023, just less than three weeks ago. Almost three weeks ago. After the collapse of our government, he was given the portfolio of the trade office. He worked together with the trade officers. He collaborated and worked closely without my or my staff’s knowledge with the Taliban and revolted against the mission, Against all diplomats, breaking all those diplomatic norms and standards, and sadly tried to implement those instructions, those orders that were given to him from Kabul”, said the Envoy. “While I was away from India at that time, spoke to him (Qadir Shah) a few times to convince him to avoid creating a situation where the mission would be in a difficult position. Sadly, he continued with the plans given to him, apparently by the Taliban. My colleagues then decided on April 29 to expel him from the mission, terminate his contract and by the time I returned here, he was no longer working for the mission”, he added. India has not yet recognised the Taliban set-up and has been pitching for the formation of a truly inclusive government in Kabul besides insisting that Afghan soil should not be used for any terrorist activities against any country. Until now, there has been no response on the matter from the Indian side."

According to police, five terrorists were involved in the killing of Farooq. “Among the accused, Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan were killed in encounters. Ayub Dar underwent a trial and was convicted for life. He is currently serving a life sentence in Srinagar central jail. Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat were absconding and hence escaped trial. They are now apprehended,” DGP Dilbagh Singh said. The arrested terrorists Javaid Ahmad Bhat and Zahoor Ahmad Bhat are residents of Srinagar. They were absconding after murdering Mirwaiz Farooq on May 21, 1990. “The two had gone underground and during all these years were hiding in Nepal and Pakistan among other places before surreptitiously returning back to Kashmir a few years ago. Maintaining a low profile, changing addresses and shifting residences, they avoided the gaze of law enforcement agencies,” said the DGP. Accused in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case (pertaining to the killing of Mirwaiz Farooq) are now liable to immediately face trial in a designated Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act (TADA) court in Delhi which has already completed the trial in respect of one of the five accused namely Ayub Dar who has been convicted and serving a life sentence. Two other absconding accused terrorists found guilty in the killing of Mirwaiz, Abdullah Bangroo and Abdul Rehman Shigan, got killed in encounters with security forces in the 1990s. To recapitulate, on May 21, 1990, Mirwaiz Farooq, the head priest of Kashmir was killed by terrorists of Hizbul Mujahideen accusing him of being a ‘peacenik’ and an ‘Indian agent’. A case was registered in Nageen police station, Srinagar to investigate the crime. Thereafter the case was transferred to CBI on June 11, 1990. After a long and arduous legal process of investigation and prosecution, the designated TADA court, in 2009, convicted the only arrested accused Ayub Dar for life. Ayub Dar, the convicted terrorist and one of the killers appealed against his conviction, which however, was upheld by the Division Bench of the Supreme Court on July 21, 2010. Before killing Mirwaiz, all five HM terrorists had gone to Pakistan for terrorist training in 1990. Back in Srinagar, Abdullah Bangroo received instructions in April 1990 from his Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) handler in Pakistan to eliminate Mirwaiz."

These rumors emerged after former Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, reportedly advocated for the procurement of 6-8 units of these bombers for long-range bombing capabilities during a think tank meeting. However, sources familiar with the matter have denied that the IAF ever expressed such requirements. In fact, it has been clarified that the IAF had previously declined an offer for the Sukhoi-34, a strike-optimized variant based on the Su-27 platform, as it no longer maintains a specific role for strategic bombers. The IAF has transitioned to multi-role fighter jets, capable of performing various roles within a single mission. The reports suggesting India’s interest in strategic bombers like the Tu-160 have been refuted by reliable sources, indicating that the IAF has not pursued such acquisitions. While discussions may have taken place in a think tank setting, there has been no official communication or requirement from the IAF to procure strategic bombers. India’s focus in recent years has been on the development and acquisition of advanced multi-role fighter aircraft, such as the Rafale jets, which provide versatility and the ability to perform a wide range of missions. These modern fighter aircraft possess advanced capabilities and technologies that enable them to fulfill multiple roles, including air superiority, ground attack, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. The IAF’s strategy aligns with its evolving operational requirements and the need for versatile platforms that can adapt to dynamic battlefield scenarios. By investing in multi-role fighters, the IAF can effectively respond to various threats and carry out complex missions, maintaining a high level of operational flexibility. While the idea of strategic bombers may have surfaced in discussions, the current focus and trajectory of the IAF’s modernization efforts revolve around enhancing its fleet of multi-role fighters. As India continues to strengthen its defense capabilities, it remains committed to equipping its air force with cutting-edge technology and platforms that optimize operational efficiency and maximize combat effectiveness."
China working towards a Permanent Presence in Indian Ocean,https://idrw.org/china-working-towards-a-permanent-presence-in-indian-ocean/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: API Chinese research vessels, which are believed to have a covert spying function, have been making frequent visits to the Indian Ocean. In addition, there are Chinese warships present in the region under the guise of anti-piracy operations. These activities indicate China’s intent to establish a permanent presence in the Indian Ocean, albeit through a different approach, according to reliable sources. Along the Makran Coast, specifically off the Baluchistan coast, China has been deploying marine buoys with the purpose of collecting data on various aspects such as water profiles. These buoys function as sensors, relaying information to a ground station that China is constructing in the Sir Creek area, not far from the Indian coast. Once operational, the station will receive the data from the sensors and transmit it back to China. The site surveys have been completed, and Chinese technicians have been observed in the region. India is also aware of China’s desire to replicate a similar setup in Sri Lanka; however, the plans have not materialized thus far. In the past, Chinese spy ships have docked at Sri Lankan ports, which elicited a strong reaction from India. The presence of Chinese research vessels and warships in the Indian Ocean has raised concerns among regional stakeholders. While China claims its activities are related to scientific research and anti-piracy efforts, their underlying objectives and potential security implications cannot be ignored. India, as a significant regional player, remains vigilant about China’s increasing presence and its strategic ambitions. The Indian government has closely monitored Chinese activities and taken measures to protect national security interests. The previous docking of Chinese spy ships in Sri Lankan ports prompted India to express its concerns, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and cooperation among regional partners. The developments in the Indian Ocean underscore the evolving dynamics and growing competition among major powers in the region. As China continues to expand its presence and influence, countries like India need to maintain a proactive approach to safeguard their interests and maintain stability in the Indian Ocean region. Efforts to enhance maritime domain awareness, intelligence sharing, and cooperation among like-minded nations become crucial in effectively addressing the challenges posed by China’s activities.

The dramatic display of Ukrainian missile defense capabilities lit up the skies of Kyiv, with debris falling after the missiles were shot down. However, the claim made by Ukraine has sparked intense debate on social media platforms. Many supporters in the Western world expressed awe at Ukraine’s ability to launch such expensive weaponry, as each Patriot PAC-3 missile has an estimated cost of $5,275,000 for the fiscal year 2024. With approximately $158,250,000 spent within a span of just two minutes, concerns have been raised about the sustainability of Ukraine’s missile inventory. The discussion on social media has focused on whether American weapons systems, provided as military aid to Ukraine, are being used to counter relatively inexpensive Russian missile systems. There are concerns that if Ukraine continues to utilize high-cost interceptors, its missile arsenal may deplete rapidly, necessitating the need for more missile deliveries funded directly by American taxpayers. While the engagement of Russian missiles by the Patriot PAC-3 system showcased Ukraine’s defense capabilities, questions have arisen regarding the cost-effectiveness and long-term viability of relying solely on expensive interceptors. As the conflict between Ukraine and Russia intensifies, it remains to be seen how the balance between cost and effectiveness in missile defense strategies will be addressed. As the online debate continues, it highlights the complex dynamics surrounding the use of advanced weaponry and the financial burdens associated with maintaining a robust missile defense system. The events in Ukraine serve as a reminder of the intricate nature of modern warfare and the intricate considerations involved in ensuring national security while managing limited resources effectively."

Permanent Mission of India in Geneva also asserted that India as G20 president has the prerogative to host its meetings in any part of the country. In his statement, Fernand de Varennes alleged that holding a G20 meeting in Jammu and Kashmir while “massive human rights violations are ongoing is lending support to attempts by India to normalise the brutal and repressive denial of democratic and other rights of Kashmiri Muslims and minorities”. Slamming the statement, India’s permanent mission in Geneva tweeted, “We @IndiaUNGeneva strongly reject the statement issued by SR on minority issues @fernanddev and the baseless and unwarranted allegations in it. As G20 president, it’s India’s prerogative to host its meetings in any part of the country.” “We are aghast that @fernanddev has acted irresponsibly to politicize this issue, misused his position as SR to publicize on social media his presumptive and prejudiced conclusions in a gross violation of the Code of Conduct for SRs,” the Indian mission said. The UN Special Rapporteur also alleged that the government is “seeking to normalise what some have described as a military occupation by instrumentalising a G20 meeting and portray an international ‘seal of approval’, despite what Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, told the UN Human Rights Council a few weeks ago was a worrying human rights situation in the Kashmir region”."

Kant calls for unfettered access to US nuclear technology to build small modular reactors,https://idrw.org/kant-calls-for-unfettered-access-to-us-nuclear-technology-to-build-small-modular-reactors/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: PTI India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant on Tuesday called for an “unfettered access” to nuclear technology from the US to build small modular reactors (SMR) in the country. He also said the private sector needs to be allowed into the atomic energy sector to take advantage of the more efficient SMRs. “India also needs to work with the US so that it is provided unfettered access to cutting edge technology by granting general authorisation to India,” Kant said addressing a session at the energy transition working group of G20 meeting here. “We should create an ability to co-produce SMRs in the US and India, and further bring down their costs,” Kant said adding that the initiative can be a win-win situation for both countries and will radically reduce time, cost overruns and and capex. The career bureaucrat-turned-Sherpa said such an access will ultimately lead to manufacturing of SMRs in India and their export also. It can be noted that India has struggled on the nuclear energy expansion front with big plants like the one at Jaitapur being built with French cooperation yet to take off. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, Kant pitched for allowing the private sector in the atomic energy space for SMRs. “Private sector participation needs to be allowed in the atomic energy sector for SMRs to take advantage of higher efficiencies,” he said, adding that state discoms should also build such plants of up to 300 MW capacity with help of the private sector. The atomic energy regulatory board has to pitch in with needful regulations for timely execution of such projects, he said. Advantages of SMRs lie in the speed of installation and cost savings, enhanced safety, flexibility of installation, base load power in support of renewables and better waste management, he said. This is the time for policy changes to ensure that modular reactors are installed in India in a manner wherein installation is increased and cost is saved, he said."

This was also the first contract signed under Mission DefSpace, the ministry said in a statement. “The first iDEX contract of Mission DefSpace was exchanged between Additional Secretary (Defence Production) and CEO Defence Innovation Organisation (DIO) T Natarajan, and CEO, InspeCity, Arindrajit Chowdhary, one of the winners of the challenge ‘Micropropulsion system for cubesats’. This challenge is being led by the Defence Space Agency,” the ministry said in the statement. It said iDEX has “reached a milestone with the signing of its 250th contract – first under Mission DefSpace – and 100th SPRINT (Navy) contract in New Delhi on May 15”. The contracts were signed in the presence of Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane and other senior civil and military officials. Cubesats are a class of small satellites which are modular, low-cost, easy to manufacture, integrate, and launch, and form a critical component for launch-on-demand capabilities. For imagery, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance communication purposes, cubesats need to be precisely aligned, hence there is a requirement of a compact micropropulsion system for precise manoeuvring and orbit correction, according to the statement. InspeCity is developing a gas-based system for this purpose. This technology, once developed, can be integrated with other satellites, including the cubesat swarm being developed under Mission DefSpace, it added. Recognising the strategic significance of the space domain, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched Mission DefSpace with 75 defence space challenges to be addressed by the private sector during DefExpo in Gandhinagar in October 2022. It aims to nurture the Indian private space industry through challenges addressing every stage of a space mission — from mission planning to satellite data analytics, officials said. “Siliconia Technologies Pvt Ltd is the winner of the challenge which envisaged the development of a prototype that is a lightweight ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) based communication system using software defined antenna for Low Earth Orbit, Medium Earth Orbit and Geostationary satellite communication. The solution by Siliconia can provide multiple independent receiver/ transmitter sources that are essential in phased-array radars, typically used in satellite tracking,” it said. It may be recalled that under the ‘SPRINT’ initiative, a total of 75 challenge statements for the Indian industry were unveiled by Prime Minister Modi during the Naval Innovation and Indigenisation Organisation (NIIO) seminar ‘Swavlamban’ on July 18, 2022. The initiative aims at inducting at least 75 technologies and products into the Indian Navy by August 2023 as part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the statement said. “The iDEX achieved the milestone of signing its first and 50th iDEX SPRINT contracts under DISC-7 in October 2022 and January 2023 respectively and within a few months the 100th SPRINT (Navy) contract was exchanged,” it added. Till date, iDEX has received more than 7,500 applications from individual innovators, MSMEs and start-ups under various categories of challenges like DISC, Prime and Open Challenge. The iDEX has also been able to generate thousands of jobs and attract India’s talent back to the country, the minstry said."
Russia and India reviving rupee settlements in trade,https://idrw.org/russia-and-india-reviving-rupee-settlements-in-trade/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: RUSSIA TODAY Several weeks after rupee-ruble talks were reportedly suspended over concerns by both Russia and India about secondary sanctions, a new mechanism has emerged to facilitate non-dollar settlements. The traditional allies are turning to settling outstanding non-oil payments with the excess Indian rupees in Moscow’s coffers, according to a top official at India’s United Commercial Bank (UCO Bank), a state-run lender. Although this is a new approach, the mechanism had actually been in the works since January. Such a move augurs well for both India and Russia amid New Delhi’s new trade policy that aims to make a dent in the hegemony of the dollar. Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov, who visited New Delhi last month for trade talks, has been forthcoming about Moscow’s eagerness to carry out transactions in “national currencies and currencies of friendly countries [read India and China]” in a bid to reduce its dependence on dollars in light of US-led Western sanctions against Moscow owing to the Ukraine conflict. The CEO of UCO Bank, Soma Shankara Prasad, said earlier that Gazprombank, a privately owned lender and Russia’s third largest bank by assets, was the first Russian banking entity to open a special rupee vostro account (SRVA) with UCO Bank last year. Since January, as many as 20 transactions in the Indian currency have been carried out, all of which relate to Indian exports to Russia, Prasad said. “The oil trade could be brought under the rupee mechanism after it is fully established and tested,” he added. Prasad’s acknowledgement of the boost to the rupee-ruble trade mechanism comes after the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, allowed Russian banking institutions to open SRVAs. A vostro is an account held by one bank on behalf of another bank. On February 6, Russian Ambassador to India Denis Alipov had said that Indian banks were cautious about using the rupee-ruble payment system to settle trade with Moscow because of concerns about secondary restrictions from the US. So far, 20 Russian banks, including Gazprombank, Rosbank, Tinkoff Bank, Centro Credit Bank and Credit Bank of Moscow, have opened SRVAs with authorized dealer banks in India to enable rupee trade between the two countries. The mechanism is gradually gaining traction, according to Prasad. It has also rekindled the so-called ‘rupee-ruble affair’, a Soviet-era mechanism with a similar aim of bypassing the dollar. The authorized dealer banks in India for SRVAs are UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, State Bank of India, Industrial Development Bank of India, Indian Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, and Punjab National Bank."

The third G20 Tourism Working Group meeting is scheduled to take place in the summer capital Srinagar from May 22 to 24. The officials said a brigadier-level officer force chaired a high-level meeting with senior police and CRPF officers at Ramban to review the security arrangements along the highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with the rest of the country. “Table-top exercise conducted by #IndianArmy & Security Agencies in #Ramban to fine-tune response to a security scenario in a coordinated manner,” Jammu-based White Knight Corps of the Army wrote on its official Twitter handle. Security has been beefed up across Jammu and Kashmir following intelligence inputs about possible attempts by terrorists to carry out a strike before or during the meeting. The anti-infiltration grid along the borders and security of vital installations, including railways stations and bus stands have been strengthened, while more checking points have come up along the highways and important cities and towns to thwart any terrorist attempt, the officials said. They said multi-tier security of the Army, Border Security Force, police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) besides Village Defence Committees have been activated along the International Border (IB) and the Line of Control (LoC). They said the security at Jammu railway station was also tightened with all agencies directed to work in close coordination and keep a close watch to foil any attempt of anti-national elements to create any kind of sabotage. Officers of the Government Railway Police and Railway Protection Force were also directed to intensify the patrolling at the railway platform areas and other sensitive areas of railway station Jammu, the officials said."
Now LoC town in Kashmir being linked to Kanyakumari by train via Delhi,https://idrw.org/now-loc-town-in-kashmir-being-linked-to-kanyakumari-by-train-via-delhi/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: IANS After creating the first rail link between Baramulla and the rest of the country, which is expected to become operational before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Indian Railways is now working on an ambitious project of providing seamless connectivity between Kanyakumari-the last train station at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent-and Uri, Kashmir’s last township, on the Line of Control (LoC) in northern India. Official sources told India Narrative that tenders have now been floated for the engineering survey of a 50 km long rail link between Baramulla and Uri. Northern Railways is planning to start Final Location Survey for Baramulla-Uri line, and proposals are being invited by the Ministry of Railways. “Tenders have been floated for engineering survey work of a Railway line using modern survey techniques such as Aerial Survey (Aerial Photogrammetric survey or Aerial LIDAR) and DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) levelling and creation of DEM,” sources said. “The rail link connecting India’s extreme South and extreme North through Delhi will be historic in the sense that it will make the seamless travel by surface communication between the country’s southern and northern tips a reality. Thereafter, one can travel directly ‘Kashmir to Kanyakumari’. In Kashmir the last station will be at Uri, close to the LoC,” said an official of Northern Railways. The Kaman Post on the LoC, also known as Aman Setu, on Srinagar-Baramulla-Uri-Muzaffarabad Road, is just 10 km from Uri. Until now, with the exception of a trade and travel link between Kashmir and the PoK, Uri has been known for all the wrong reasons. For years, it was a notorious infiltration route on which the Indian and the Pakistani troops traded shelling. Hundreds of militant recruits went across and came in through Uri. Many of them were killed in encounters. As many as 72 infiltrating terrorists were killed in an encounter when JJ Singh-who subsequently rose to the position of the Indian Army chief-was a Commanding Officer of a battalion in Uri in 1992. Brigadier Sridhar of the Indian Army was killed here in an IED blast in March 1995. On 18-19 September, 2016, as many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a fidayeen attack on their camp. On 28 September, the Indian troops conducted surgical strikes at terror targets across the LoC. The cross-LoC trade and travel, which had been started through Uri in Kashmir and Chakan Da Bagh in Poonch (Jammu) in 2005-07, suffered a major setback due to the terror attack followed by the Indian retaliation in 2016. However, it was permanently closed after the killing of 40 CRPF personnel in another terror strike near Awantipora, on Srinagar-Jammu highway, on 14 February 2019. On 26 February, 2019, the Indian Air Force jets crossed the LoC and dropped bombs at a terror installation in Balakot, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The situation has drastically changed after withdrawal of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and its division into the two separate Union Territories in August 2019. Immediately after the Covid pandemic in 2021-22, Uri was opened for tourists. The Government is now planning to develop Uri into a place of tourist attraction. As of now, there is road connectivity between Srinagar/Baramulla and Uri. Currently the last train station in northern India is at Baramulla. Now the rail connectivity is being extended to Uri through a 50 km track for which the survey will start shortly. “The rail link between Kanyakumari, Delhi, Jammu, Srinagar, Baramulla and Uri will remain operational on a 24x7x365 basis. It will hugely benefit not only the large number of the Army and BSF personnel but also Kashmir’s fruit traders, common travellers and tourists. Most of the Army and BSF supplies, which currently come through trucks and transport planes, will be routed through goods trains,” said an official. The Jammu-Srinagar highway remains disturbed or closed for traffic for several days a year due to landslides caused by inclement weather coupled with massive traffic jams. Even the air link between Srinagar and the rest of the country remains disrupted by snowfall and poor visibility at the Srinagar airport. The rail link and completion of the highway will be a major milestone in the 75-year-long journey of Kashmir’s physical integration with India. Currently the only surface lifeline, the 260 km long Jammu-Srinagar road, which is a part of NH-44, is being developed into a 4-lane highway through a large number of tunnels, viaducts, bridges and flyovers. While most of the works have been completed on Srinagar and Jammu side, construction of some tunnels and development of road is underway on the most challenging part between Nashri and Banihal. Efforts are underway to complete and inaugurate this whole project before May 2024. The train currently operates up to Katra on the Jammu side and up to Banihal, from Baramulla, on the Kashmir side. Works are in progress in the most challenging part between Katra and Banihal. This 110 km long track passes through a large number of tunnels and bridges including the one over the Chenab river which has got the distinction of becoming the world’s tallest railway bridge."

Suffering experienced by Palestinians one of greatest injustices in modern times: Palestinian envoy,https://idrw.org/suffering-experienced-by-palestinians-one-of-greatest-injustices-in-modern-times-palestinian-envoy/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The suffering experienced by the Palestinian people is one of the greatest injustices in modern times, Palestine’s ambassador to India Adnan Mohammad Jaber Abualhayjaa said here on Monday. “There is no doubt that the suffering experienced by the Palestinian people is one of the greatest injustices in modern times. This started with the … of people’s existence in their homeland, designing unjust colonial policies to control their land and resources and then practising a documented ethnic cleansing against them,” Abualhayjaa said in the India-Palestine Friendship Forum. While speaking at the Forum commemorating the 75th anniversary of ‘Nakba’, Abualhayjaa stressed that they cannot turn a blind eye to the consequence of the tragedy. He said that Palestinians despite living in exile across various nations and refugee camps continue to cling to their legitimate hopes and still retain the keys to their ancestors’ seized homes. “No matter how much time passes on the 75th anniversary of Nakba, it would be unfair to overlook Britain and the Western countries and their responsibility for this ongoing tragedy inflicted upon the Palestinian people. Most of them have been uprooted and displaced from their land,” the Palestinian envoy said. “We cannot turn a blind eye to the consequences of this tragedy, which generations of Palestinians continue to pay the price. So far, we are well aware that most Palestinian currently live in dismal refugee camps or are scattered across various countries … around the world. However, they still cling to their legitimate hope and they still retain the keys to their ancestors’ seized homes,” he added. Abualhayjaa said that Palestinian people continue to astonish with their determination to reclaim freedom as stipulated by international rights. He said that the Nakba commemoration is not a fleeting event. “Generation after generation, the Palestinian people continue to astonish us with their unwavering determination to reclaim their freedom, independence and inalienable rights, including the right to return to their land and homes as stipulated by international conventions and resolutions,” Abualhayjaa said. “The Nakba commemoration is not a fleeting event. The Palestinian cause remains alive and its incident are continuous for example, the targeting of the town of Hawara in the West Bank by a horrifying collective arson campaign carried out by armed settlers, which was seen by the entire world, attempts to uproot Palestinian families from their neighbourhoods and towns continue, as seen in … and Khan al-Ahmar,” he added. Abualhayjaa said that reports directly from the field sound the alarm over escalating policies of “land confiscation and the explosion of residents from Palestine villages and towns in the West Bank.” He further said, “all these incidents give the impression that the aftermath of the Nakba has not ceased.” He called it a matter of urgency for the international community to act to protect the Palestinians. Abualhayjaa called on the international community to take rapid action to protect the people of Palestine and ensure their human security. “As Israel is clearly intent on carrying on with such brutality and impunity, a fact affirmed daily by the inflammatory rhetoric and incitement and the streets made by Israeli officials, it is a matter of urgency that international community act to protect the Palestinian civilian population and to deter the preparation of more crimes by Israelis, the occupying power,” Abualhayjaa “We urge all states to pursue them collectively and in … in line with their obligations under international law, including as high constructing parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, to ensure respect to all circumstances. We thus call again the serious and rapid action to protect the Palestinian people and to ensure their human security and to bring an end to the illegal colonial Israeli occupation and apartheid regime that has been the cause of so much human suffering for decades and has precluded the realization of a just and lasting peace and security in the region,” he added."

Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for an RWI RPAS with a range of 80-100 km, capable of tactical surveillance, target acquisition, Direction of Own Artillery Fire (DOOAF), and Post Strike Damage Assessment (PSDA). Several Indian private sector companies have responded to the tender, offering RPAS equipped with a range of capabilities. These RPAS can be integrated with EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infrared) systems, Laser Target Designators (LTDs), wide-area motion imagery (WAMI), communications intelligence (COMINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), electronic warfare (EW) systems, maritime patrol radar (MPR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), automatic identification system (AIS), and other integrated sensors. Additionally, they can be used for communications relay and SATCOM (Satellite Communications). The RPAS offered by the private sector companies is designed to be highly transportable, allowing for easy deployment on vehicle-mounted systems. They feature advanced navigation systems that remain operational even in GPS-denied areas and can operate under harsh weather conditions, including below cloud bases. The RPAS are specifically designed for covert operations, with low silhouettes and silent flight capabilities. Operational versatility and flexibility are key features of these RPAS, along with a small logistic footprint, rapid assembly, and quick turnaround time. They offer autonomous flight modes, and full redundancy, and can be launched and recovered using launchers, parachutes, or vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) techniques. The introduction of these RPAS will significantly enhance the surveillance and target acquisition capabilities of the SATA units, allowing for more effective and timely engagement of time-critical targets."
"Japanese PM Kishida to take PM Modi, other leaders to Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum",https://idrw.org/japanese-pm-kishida-to-take-pm-modi-other-leaders-to-hiroshima-peace-memorial-museum/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: UNI Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is preparing to take the leaders of the invited countries to the G7 Summit, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Japan is welcoming the heads of government from the G7 countries for meetings in the western Japanese city of Hiroshima on May 19, 20, and 21. The three-day meeting will start from May 19 at Grand Prince Hotel Hiroshima. The G7 leaders will be joined by the leaders of South Korea, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Comoros – as well as senior representatives from the European Union. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is joining in the summit online. Kishida will take Prime Minister Modi, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, and other leaders of invited non-member G7 states, as well as the heads of seven international organizations including U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, to the Hiroshima Museum. The visit to the museum is planned for May 19, as a group. PM Kishida will serve as a guide in an effort to build momentum for realizing a world without nuclear weapons, a report said. Opened 10 years after the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima to convey to the world the reality of nuclear warfare, the museum exhibits victims’ belongings and materials that show how the city looked before and after the attack. The museum will also be visited by G7 leaders such as U.S. President Joe Biden. Kishida hopes to create among the leaders a common understanding of the horrors of nuclear radiation and the need to abolish nuclear weapons, as part of his lifelong effort to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. The Japanese government is also planning for a visit to the facility by the spouses of the G7 leaders, with Kishida’s wife, Yuko, expected to serve as a guide. Security is tight around the Peace Memorial Museum. Prime Minister Kishida, who represents Hiroshima constituency, visited the city and spoke to about 100 police and coast guard officers at the hotel on Saturday. The officers are part of the contingent that are being deployed in the city and surrounding areas for the summit. PM Kishida inspected the Grand Prince Hotel Hiroshima, which will serve as the primary site for the summit; the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which the prime minister will visit with other G7 leaders; and Miyajima Island, home to Itsukushima Shrine, a World Heritage site. On August 8, 1945, a nuclear bomb killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima. Ever since, the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Hibakusha, live with the collective understanding that nuclear weapons must never be used again.Russia’s invasion is expected to top the agenda at the summit. Other topics will likely include the push to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. The G7 outcome document is expected to include the strengthening of support for food production in the Global South and the diversification of global food supply chains. The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, plus the European Union. Biden"
"India’s Modi out to deepen their bonds,but geopolitical friendships have their limits",https://idrw.org/biden-indias-modi-out-to-deepen-their-bonds-but-geopolitical-friendships-have-their-limits/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: AP President Joe Biden has made it a mission for the U.S. to build friendships overseas — and the next few weeks will offer a vivid demonstration of the importance he’s placing on a relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two are both scheduled to attend this week’s Group of Seven summit in Japan, a subsequent gathering of Pacific island leaders in Papua New Guinea, and a later meeting of Indo-Pacific leaders in Australia. Those travels will be followed by a June 22 state visit by Modi to Washington, a sign that both seem willing to deepen their bonds. But like many geopolitical friendships, things are complicated between the world’s largest economy (the U.S.) and its most populous nation (India). The personal outreach has a clear strategic calculus as both countries respond to China’s economic rise and increased global prominence. Yet while Biden champions democratic ideals and openly opposes Russia for invading Ukraine, Modi has offered tepid criticism of Russia and opponents say he is eroding India’s democratic traditions. That means the future of the alliance depends on a degree of patience. “It’s a long game of steady forward movement in defense relations and some fairly rapid intensification of business ties — with the pace of both determined by the speed of movement on the Indian side,” said Kurt Tong, a former ambassador for the U.S. who is now managing partner of The Asia Group, a consultancy. Biden last year publicly called India’s response to the war in Ukraine “shaky.” India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Modi had a relatively warm relationship with Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, and has made some efforts to forge a connection with Biden, who is known to focus on his Irish roots even when meeting with leaders of other nations. When Modi came to Washington in September 2021, he brought with him documents about people with the last name “Biden” in India. “Are we related?” Biden asked. “Yes,” Modi joked. While visiting Canada in March, Biden said he’s made it a strategic goal to improve relations with the rest of the world as he feels that America’s leverage against China and Russia is through its alliances. “I have now met with 80% of the world leaders just since I’ve been president,” he said. “We’re the ones expanding the alliances. The opposition is not.” Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a biographer of Modi, said the Indian leader’s connection with Biden is not personal — and has its limits. But it is necessary for the U.S. to keep India on its side as tensions with China have accelerated over Taiwan, the federal government’s ban on exporting advanced computer chips to China and human rights issues. “To what extent can India be part of the U.S.-led alliance, that is for Modi to decide,” Mukhopadhyay said. “At some point or the other, the Americans would realize that Modi is not really going the whole hog as much as they would like India to be. But Modi will not get swayed by meeting Biden several times.” Nirupama Rao, a retired diplomat who served as Indian ambassador to the U.S., said India has its reasons for not joining the condemnation of Moscow. “The country wants Russia to maintain some distance from China, and it worries that isolating Moscow would just push it closer to Beijing,” she said. Relations between India and China are strained, with the two sides embroiled in an intense three-year standoff involving thousands of soldiers stationed along their disputed border in the eastern Ladakh region. Rao said U.S. policymakers should not mistake India’s involvement in the so-called Quad — whose other members are the U.S., Japan and Australia — for an alliance. India is also in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a group dominated by Beijing and Moscow. It routinely attends trilateral meetings with China and Russia. It also continues to participate in the forum known as BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. “So far, India has done an impressive job of maintaining its balancing act,” she said. “Whether it can continue to do so in the years ahead is an open question. Beijing has become increasingly belligerent, and it may eventually decide it will not deal with India if New Delhi strengthens its security ties to Washington.” Both the U.S. and India have been emphasizing technology partnerships, including defense, clean energy and space. During Modi’s visit to the U.S. in June, the two leaders are also expected to discuss common challenges, including climate change and health security. Russia is India’s largest supplier of military hardware. But India has been reducing its dependence on Russian arms by diversifying its purchases, buying from the U.S., France, Germany and other countries. The U.S. defense trade with India has risen from near zero in 2008 to over $20 billion in 2020. The U.S. imported about $86 billion in goods from India last year, according to the Census Bureau. That figure has steadily increased, but it has room to grow as the U.S. still gets more goods from Taiwan and Vietnam than India. With more than 1.4 billion people, India is about 14 times the size of Taiwan and Vietnam combined. There are some risks for Biden as he devotes more time to Modi, with advocates for human rights wary of the Indian leader’s track record. The freedom of the news media in India has been challenged after Modi became prime minister in 2014. Political rivals of Modi’s governing Hindu nationalist party have accused him of stifling dissent and introducing divisive policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities. Modi’s Hindu nationalist party also suffered a political setback as India’s main opposition Congress party won control of the southern Karnataka state, according to a near complete vote count Saturday. The victory could help unite the largely divided opposition in next year’s general election, in which Modi will seek a third consecutive term as prime minister. Yet for Biden, developing a personal rapport out of public view might be critical for overcoming any differences with Modi. “In this case, the investment is worth it,” said Lisa Curtis, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank. “There are a lot of things that President Biden can say privately to Prime Minister Modi that could end up having a favorable impact on U.S.-India relations.”"
"Far too many countries including Russia, India, China and Saudi Arabia continue to target faith community members: US official",https://idrw.org/far-too-many-countries-including-russia-india-china-and-saudi-arabia-continue-to-target-faith-community-members-us-official/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: PTI A senior US official on Monday said far too many governments, including Russia, India, China and Saudi Arabia, continue to freely target faith community members, as the state department released its Congressional-mandatory annual report on international religious freedom that documents the status of religious freedom in countries across the world. “Far too many governments continue to freely target faith community members within their borders,” Rashad Hussain, Ambassador at Large, Office of International Religious Freedom, told reporters at a news conference here soon after the annual 2022 “Report on International Religious Freedom” was released by Secretary of State Tony Blinken. The report provides a fact-based, comprehensive view of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world, Blinken said, noting that it aims to highlight areas where freedom of religion or belief is being repressed to promote accountability and ultimately, drive progress toward a world where freedom of religion or belief is a reality for everyone everywhere. Blinken did not mention India in his remarks and the India section of the annual report is almost similar to that of the previous years, which is more or less a documentation of allegations of violation of religious freedom raised by multiple media outlets and non-governmental organisations inside and outside the country. Hussain mentioned India in the context of the key findings of the report in terms of governments continuing to freely target faith communities. “In India, legal advocates and faith leaders from across the country’s diverse religious communities condemned a case of extreme hate speech against Muslims in the city of Haridwar, calling for the country to uphold its historical traditions of pluralism and tolerance. And the Burma military regime continues to repress the Rohingya population, causing many to flee their homes,” Hussain said as he listed out a few other countries starting with Russia and followed by China and Afghanistan. “I would like to share some key findings from this year’s report regarding religious discrimination and hatred at the governmental and societal levels and describe what we are doing to address it,” Hussain said. The India section of the document said there were numerous reports during the year of violence by law enforcement authorities against members of religious minorities in multiple states, including plainclothes police in Gujarat publicly flogging four Muslim men accused of injuring Hindu worshippers during a festival in October and the Madhya Pradesh government bulldozing Muslim-owned houses and shops following communal violence in Khargone in April. The report noted that in September, Rasthtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat met with five prominent members of the Muslim community to listen to their concerns and discuss how to promote communal harmony between Muslims and Hindus. “Bhagwat reportedly committed to continued meetings for the purpose of improving relations between the Muslim and Hindu communities. Bhagwat also met with Umer Ahmed Ilyasi, head of the All India Imam Organisation, at a Delhi-area madrassah run by that organisation. Media reported that some Muslim groups welcomed Bhagwat’s engagement, while others described it as ‘just optics’ and preparation for the 2024 parliamentary elections,” it said. “In 2021, Bhagwat had stated publicly that Hindus and Muslims in the country should not be treated differently because of religion and that killing non-Hindus for cow slaughter was an act against Hinduism,” the report said. In a statement, US Commission for International Religious Freedom Chair Nury Turkel said the International Religious Freedom Report is an invaluable tool in the fight to hold violators accountable and improve global religious freedom conditions. “With this report, the state department shows the entire world that the United States is committed to the fundamental value of religious freedom,” he said."
Australia to donate Beechcraft KA350 plane to Sri Lanka upon India’s request,https://idrw.org/australia-to-donate-beechcraft-ka350-plane-to-sri-lanka-upon-indias-request/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: AFI In a move mirroring India’s efforts to strengthen security ties with Sri Lanka as part of its Indian Ocean outreach, Australia has announced its decision to gift an air force aircraft to enhance Sri Lanka’s sovereign aerial maritime surveillance capability. This gesture reflects Australia’s commitment to expanding cooperation and security collaboration with the island nation. The aim is to bolster Sri Lanka’s capabilities in monitoring its maritime domain and ensuring the safety and security of its territorial waters. Australian Government has announced its intention to gift a former Royal Australian Air Force Beechcraft KA350 King Air aircraft (registration A32-673) to the Sri Lankan Government. The aircraft will be utilized to enhance Sri Lanka’s sovereign aerial maritime surveillance capability. This announcement was made during a meeting between an Australian delegation led by Australian High Commissioner Paul Stephens and President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Secretariat. The donation of the aircraft reflects Australia’s commitment to bolstering collaboration and cooperation between the two countries. A key area of focus in the Australia-Sri Lanka relationship is countering transnational crime, including drug smuggling, and strengthening border management through intelligence sharing and efforts to deter, disrupt, intercept, and return maritime people smuggling operations under Operation Sovereign Borders. The Australian Government highly values the ongoing cooperation, which has resulted in the disruption of numerous maritime people smuggling ventures and the protection of vulnerable individuals by preventing criminal exploitation, perilous sea journeys, and loss of life at sea. In the wake of the visit by the Australian Minister for Home Affairs to Sri Lanka in June of the previous year, the Home Affairs Department has been actively driving various new initiatives in partnership with multiple Sri Lankan Government departments. Throughout the pursuit of these initiatives, Australia has underscored the significance of supporting Sri Lanka in developing its sovereign capabilities."
DRDO Espionage Case: ATS Informs Pune Court of Pakistan Operative’s Contact with Top Scientist and IAF Personnel,https://idrw.org/drdo-espionage-case-ats-informs-pune-court-of-pakistan-operatives-contact-with-top-scientist-and-iaf-personnel/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: AFI The court proceedings of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) espionage case took a startling turn when it was revealed that an employee of the Indian Air Force (IAF) was also in contact with the Pakistani intelligence operative (PIO). The development emerged during the hearing for the extension of police custody of DRDO scientist Pradeep Kurulkar, who was arrested in connection with the case. The involvement of the IAF employee raises significant concerns and adds a new dimension to the ongoing investigation into the espionage network. Nikhil Shende, an IAF employee who joined the force through the sports quota, came under scrutiny during the investigation conducted by the Maharashtra police’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS). The ATS was looking into individuals who may have been targeted by the same person who had ensnared Kurulkar. Shende, stationed in Bengaluru and hailing from Nagpur, was identified as having connections to the case. During the court proceedings regarding the extension of custody, it was disclosed that the alleged IAF employee’s involvement had prompted a departmental inquiry. Shende’s contact with the same IP address used to connect with DRDO scientists raised suspicions. His statement has been registered by the Pune Court under CrPC Section 164. The revelation of an IAF officer’s involvement raises further questions about the scope and complexity of the espionage network. During the recent court hearing, the prosecution sought an extension of Kurulkar’s custody, emphasizing the need for further interrogation in the case. The defense countered by stating that all relevant devices had already been seized and that Kurulkar had been fully cooperating with the authorities. Taking these arguments into consideration, the court granted an additional day of police custody for Kurulkar. The allegations against Kurulkar revolve around his communication with a Pakistan Intelligence Operative through WhatsApp and video calls, suggesting a potential honeytrap operation. Following his arrest, Kurulkar was charged under the relevant sections of the Official Secrets Act, highlighting the severity of the accusations leveled against him."

In collaboration with the state government and other stakeholders, the army is working to create a sense of safety among all communities, particularly those residing in remote areas outside the Imphal valley. The deployment of army and Assam Rifles columns, along with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is underway to facilitate area domination exercises and expedite the return of normalcy in Manipur. More than 128 army and Assam Rifles columns, along with UAVs, have been actively engaged in area domination exercises. The primary objective is to regain complete normalcy in Manipur as quickly as possible. To achieve this, long-duration patrols comprising women soldiers from the Assam Rifles have been dispatched to vulnerable areas identified in consultation with the state government over the past 72 hours. These area domination patrols have been visiting villages across various communities, interacting with locals, women, and influencers. Their purpose is to not only reassure the residents of their safety but also provide much-needed support. Activities conducted by these patrols include rendering medical assistance on-site by para medics and undertaking prophylactic medical evacuations when necessary. The army has called upon all sections of the population in Manipur to support the efforts of the security forces in maintaining the hard-earned peace and harmony.

He said three major actions had been taken in the last few months during which persons linked with Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), Popular Front of India, and HuT were arrested. “The MP Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) arrested 22 persons linked with Popular Front of India (PFI) from Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain and Neemuch, while 16 persons linked with Hizb-Ut-Tahrir were held including ten from Bhopal, one from Chhindwara and five from Hyderabad,” Mishra, who is the state government spokesperson, told reporters. Queried on the HuT network and the role of the arrested persons, he said the investigation revealed so far that seven persons have converted to Islam. “Surprisingly, these persons involved in brainwashing are not normal ones. One of them is a professor, another is a gym trainer, while a third runs a coaching class…one of them is a software engineer and another is a software technician. Such types of people are involved in love jihad. They brainwash Hindu girls into marrying them. First Hindu men convert to Islam and later these girls are also converted,” the minister said. “Love jihad” is a term often used by right-wing activists to allege a ploy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into religious conversion through marriage. Mishra said the state police will act as a “pesticide against jehadi cockroaches and will eliminate them after tracing them”. He said such conspiracies will not be allowed to succeed in Madhya Pradesh. Mishra questioned the double standards of those people who he said are raising their voices against “The Kerala Story” but remain silent about HuT, PFI, terrorism and religious conversion. “This exposed their dual policies and the policy of appeasement,” he added."
Terrorists using phones without SIMs to remain out of Radar in Kashmir,https://idrw.org/terrorists-using-phones-without-sims-to-remain-out-of-radar-in-kashmir/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: UNI Security agencies have recently reported a concerning development in the tactics employed by terror outfits in Kashmir. These groups are increasingly utilizing a technology known as YSMS (Yellow Stone Message Service) to communicate covertly. YSMS involves communication via VHF (very high frequency) using smartphones, enabling terrorists to relay messages, send SOS appeals, and share precise locations to other paired devices within line-of-sight range. YSMS is a rudimentary yet highly surreptitious tool used by terror organizations. It involves the use of smartphones without SIM cards, which are then paired with radio sets. By exploiting VHF frequencies, terrorists can establish communication channels that are difficult to detect or intercept. This method enables them to exchange messages and vital information discreetly, increasing their operational capabilities and reducing the chances of interception by security agencies. The use of YSMS technology presents significant challenges for security agencies in their efforts to combat terrorism. Firstly, the simplicity and accessibility of the technique make it difficult to track or monitor. Unlike encrypted messaging applications or other sophisticated communication methods, YSMS technology requires minimal resources and expertise, making it an attractive choice for terror groups. Secondly, the lack of clarity regarding the full range of methods employed by terrorists to communicate further complicates the task for security agencies. While the report highlights YSMS as a prominent tool, it acknowledges that there may be other undisclosed techniques being utilized. The constant emergence of new communication methods demands ongoing surveillance and research to stay one step ahead of the evolving threat landscape. According to sources, terror outfits in Kashmir are allegedly planning an attack during the upcoming G20 meeting, aiming to create a “26/11-like situation.” The intent is to orchestrate a prolonged conflict while foreign dignitaries are present in Jammu and Kashmir. The utilization of YSMS technology in such a scenario could potentially enable terrorists to coordinate their actions, share real-time information, and maintain operational secrecy, increasing the complexity of preventing and responding to attacks. In light of the evolving communication methods employed by terror outfits, security agencies must adapt their strategies to effectively counter the threat. This includes investing in advanced surveillance technologies capable of detecting and identifying YSMS transmissions. Furthermore, intelligence sharing among international agencies becomes crucial to stay updated on emerging trends and to develop effective countermeasures. Additionally, ongoing efforts to enhance cybersecurity and encryption technologies should continue. By bolstering encryption protocols and developing more secure communication channels, the risk of terrorists exploiting communication vulnerabilities can be reduced."
Partition Museum In Delhi’s Dara Shikoh Library To Open On Thursday,https://idrw.org/partition-museum-in-delhis-dara-shikoh-library-to-open-on-thursday/,"May 16, 2023","SOURCE: PTI A museum themed on the Partition, telling the story of the 1947 tragedy and representing the pain and trauma suffered by people on both sides of the border, is all set to open at the Mughal-era Dara Shikoh Library building here on May 18. This will be the second such museum after the Partition Museum of Amritsar located in the historic Town Hall. The opening will coincide with International Museum Day. The Art, Culture and Languages Department of the Delhi government shared tweets with descriptive posts about the upcoming museum. “As we approach the launch of the Partition Museum on May 18th, 2023, we are excited to share fascinating details about how this historic event shaped Delhi. Only 3 days to go!,” it tweeted. The library building is located in Delhi’s Kashmere Gate area. The museum will tell the story of the 1947 tragedy through interactive media. On February 17, the then Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia visited the museum site and inspected the progress of the project. The Deputy Chief Minister’s office had earlier said in a statement that the building of the historic library, built in 1637, was being converted into a 1947 Partition Museum by the Delhi government under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. “The second such museum in India, it will have seven galleries to explain the events leading up to the Partition, and Independence, migration, refugees, rebuilding homes, art, relationships and will also have a gallery of hope and courage,” it said. The museum will also feature a “virtual reality experience”, donated belongings of people who witnessed the Partition, and a souvenir shop. The library will also serve as a cultural hub with exhibitions on different aspects of the city and its history. Sisodia after his visit had said that historical buildings located across Delhi symbolise the country’s evolution over a period of time, adding the city government has “prioritised restoration” of these landmarks to help current generations understand the country better. There could not have been a better place than the Dara Shikoh Library to house the Partition Museum, he had said. The museum would endeavour to depict the memories of the 1947 Partition as experienced by people, officials said. The period transformed Delhi significantly and major parts of the national capital, including areas like Lajpat Nagar, C R Park and Punjabi Bagh, were established after the Partition. The city’s Art, Culture and Languages Department is sharing on Twitter tidbits about institutions that were originally located in Lahore and other cities and suffered the pangs of the Partition too, such as the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and Dyal Singh College. It also shared how some of the food items were brought to Delhi by refugees, and markets set up for rehabilitating refugees such as Meherchand Market in Lodhi Road area. The museum would feature seven customised galleries designed to explain all aspects of India’s Partition and the struggle for Independence to visitors. Witnessing the same rail coaches, ancient havelis, and replicas of refugee camps would be exciting and nostalgic for many, the statement had said. Many people who witnessed the Partition have donated items such as clothes, utensils, books as well as belongings from refugee camps to the museum, officials said. It will also have a special gallery dedicated to Sindh, the statement said. The museum would also include a ‘Gallery of Hope and Courage’ which would display photographs, mementoes, and experiences of people revisiting their ancient properties and places in Pakistan, decades after the Partition. The Dara Shikoh Library building was originally built in 1637 by Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. After the death of Shikoh, this mansion was handed over to Bahadur Shah I, heir apparent of Aurangzeb. “Sometime after his ascension, the property was handed over to Juliana Dias da Costa, a lady of Portuguese descent who played a prominent role in his court. Abul Mansur Mirza Muhammad Muqim Ali Khan (Safdarjung) bought the property very cheaply from the descendants of Juliana Dias da Costa and made it his residence,” the statement added. Under British rule, it served as a British Residency for David Ochterlony, Archibald Seton and Charles Metcalf. In the 20th century, the property was also used as a school, a polytechnic and lastly as the offices of the Delhi State Archaeology Department. Thereafter, The Arts And Cultural Heritage Trust (TAACHT) was entrusted with the building under the ‘Adopt A Heritage’ scheme of the Centre, by the Department of Art, Culture and Language, to set up the Partition Museum."
"Need to promote innovations useful for defence, civil sectors: Rajnath Singh",https://idrw.org/need-to-promote-innovations-useful-for-defence-civil-sectors-rajnath-singh/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said that institutions need to promote innovation which is not only useful for the defence industry but also for civilian purposes. “We need to promote such innovations in the defence sector which are not only useful for defence but also equally effective for the civil sector,” Rajnath Singh said at the 12th convocation ceremony of the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) in Pune. He cited examples of how the use of navigation systems was initially started for defence requirements but later on became an important part of civilian life. “Plastic surgery is also deeply related to the defence sector. We see that many a time soldiers get injured during the war, and different parts of their bodies get damaged in an unfortunate way. For this plastic surgery is a boon which is also helping civilian life,” the Defence minister said. Rajnath Singh said countries have to move fast towards technological advancement. “We have to keep in mind that if our adversaries have more advanced technologies, then it can become a problem for us in the coming times. That’s why we have to move fast towards technological advancement along with the changing environment,” he said. The minister said apart from land and air, threats can come from cyberspace and the space sector. Concepts like non-kinetic or contactless warfare have made the need for advanced technology in the defence sector more important than ever, the minister said. “In the last few decades, we have seen that the methods of warfare are changing at a faster rate…. The dangers of conventional war are in front of us, but going beyond them, now completely new types of threats are looming in front of us,” added Rajnath Singh. He also touched upon the government’s Atmanirbhar push and highlighted that a huge country like India cannot depend on imports. “If we only import defence equipment and platforms, it will make us dependent on other countries in the defence sector. This dependence can also be a hindrance to our strategic autonomy,” he said. Rajnath Singh also met former President Pratibha Patil and personally expressed condolences to her on the demise of her spouse Dr Devisingh Shekhawat."

"India, Russia settling some non-oil trade in rupees: Top UCO Bank official",https://idrw.org/india-russia-settling-some-non-oil-trade-in-rupees-top-uco-bank-official/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: REUTERS India and Russia have been settling some of their non-oil trade in rupees since the beginning of this year, said a top official at state-run Indian lender UCO Bank, which is involved in the transactions. Last year, the Reserve Bank of India announced a mechanism to settle foreign trade in rupees, aimed at internationalising its use. Russia is also keen to do more trade in “national currencies and currencies of friendly countries,” its Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said in April, to reduce its reliance on U.S. dollars after Western sanctions over its war in Ukraine. So far, Russia’s Gazprombank is the only foreign bank that has opened a special rupee vostro account with UCO Bank, UCO Chief Executive Soma Shankara Prasad told Reuters. Prasad said UCO had received requests from other foreign banks, including some from Russia, to open special rupee vostro accounts. “About 19-20 transactions have happened (in rupees) since January … All these transactions have been Indian exports to Russia,” he said. Prasad said Russia was paying Indian exporters in rupees from payments received in Gazprombank’s rupee vostro account for a “couple” of transactions with Indian importers, including the purchase of pollution measuring equipment by an Indian buyer. “We are happy that two-way trade in rupee has started. It is at a very early, nascent stage and we hope that this is going to pick up”, he said, adding if both sides want, oil trade could be brought under the rupee mechanism after it is fully established and tested. The arrangement mirrors the mechanism India adopted to settle trade with Iran, where its oil payments to Tehran in rupees were used to supply non-sanctioned goods to the Islamic nation. UCO Bank was also involved in settling that trade. Both Gazprombank and Russia’s Trade and Industry Ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that India and Russia had suspended negotiations to settle trade in rupees as the trade balance was tilted in favour of Moscow due to surging Russian oil imports by New Delhi. India’s annual trade with Russia more than tripled to $44.4 billion in the fiscal year to March 31, from $13.1 billion the year before. Russia overtook Iraq for the first time as the top oil supplier to India in 2022/23, data obtained from trade sources showed. To fix this trade imbalance Russia wants to expand supplies from India, such as machinery imports, components and equipment for road construction, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, Russia’s Manturov said in April. Manturov also said the countries were in talks for a free trade agreement and a bilateral investment agreement. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, said earlier this month that talks were underway with India to exchange billions of rupees that have accumulated in Indian banks for other currencies."
Escalating Cross-Border Threats: Pakistan’s Strategy Includes Increased Terror Launch Pads near LoC,https://idrw.org/escalating-cross-border-threats-pakistans-strategy-includes-increased-terror-launch-pads-near-loc/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: API Recent intelligence reports reveal a concerning two-pronged offensive strategy by Pakistan. Firstly, there is an alarming concentration of terrorists in launch pads along the Line of Control (LoC). Some of these launch pads are situated precariously close to the border. Reports indicate that terrorist groups are already present in the region and have planned attacks on security force vehicles and convoys. The Mendhar area is believed to be a potential target, with intentions to strike at a colony of Kashmiri pandits. Other areas that are reportedly under threat include Awantipore, Pampore, and Pulwama. Simultaneously, Pakistan has instructed its missions abroad to propagate a narrative labeling Uttar Pradesh as a “butcher state” due to the tragic murder of Atiq Ahmed. They aim to create a false perception that minorities are not safe in India. Additionally, Pakistan has been discussing the Northeastern states, attempting to portray the Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of over 40 security personnel, as a “false flag” operation conducted by Jaish-e-Mohammed. However, the credibility of such propaganda remains highly questionable, as it is unlikely to find receptive audiences. Pakistan’s coordinated efforts to infiltrate terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir while spreading misleading information through foreign missions reflect a dangerous escalation. These actions not only threaten regional stability but also undermine the genuine aspirations of peace and security. It is crucial for the international community to remain vigilant and reject such baseless propaganda that aims to sow discord and disrupt the progress towards peace in the region."
"Russia Hits Immobile And Predictable M-777, AHS Krab, And M-109 Howitzers Hard",https://idrw.org/russia-hits-immobile-and-predictable-m-777-ahs-krab-and-m-109-howitzers-hard/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: FORBES To date, Ukraine has received at least 390 pieces of towed artillery and 440 self-propelled guns. NATO’s “big guns” have performed well in Ukrainian hands, but they are suffering heavy losses to Russian action. As imagery of successful attacks on Western gear accumulates, they suggest that Ukraine must keep their artillery pieces on the move, avoiding predictable patterns of operation. Open-source data compiled by the indefatigable researchers behind the Oryx website suggest that Ukraine’s heaviest towed artillery— guns that cannot move themselves and are heavy enough to be an occasional mobility challenge—are getting hit. Ukraine’s loss rates are brutal. Of the approximately 152 big M777 155mm towed howitzers that “officially” arrived in Ukraine, over a third have already been damaged or destroyed. Imagery of Russian strikes on the NATO-standard 155-mm howitzers show signs that the successfully targeted guns had become static battlefield assets—firing from positions heaped with piles of shells or blasting away from longstanding battlefield emplacements. Detritus around many of the hit guns suggest they had been firing from a single position long enough for Russia’s ponderous command-and-control apparatus to swing into action, ambushing Ukraine’s big guns. But mobility isn’t the only answer. Russia is also hitting old-school self-propelled artillery systems—guns that can move about under their own power. Both the AHS Krab, a Polish-designed South Korean and British hybrid gun system, and America’s functional equivalent, the hard-working M-109 mobile howitzer, are getting hit rather hard, with loss rates ranging somewhere between eighteen to twenty-one percent. With over 180 delivered, at least 36 have been damaged or destroyed. Again, imagery of successful Russian strikes suggests roughly half the destroyed mobile howitzers were caught in static firing points or had set into a pattern, operating from detectable positions. In contrast, smaller and more mobile artillery platforms don’t seem to be getting hit much at all. Thus far, at least 166 105mm towed artillery pieces have arrived in Ukraine. Of the array of British L118/119s, U.S.-built M101s and M119s, along with some OTO Melara Mod 56 105mm howitzers, open-source researchers have only confirmed damage to a single 105mm gun. This lower loss rate may reflect the smaller platform’s relative mobility as well as their proximity to the front line. The 105mm guns are, in general, no more than half the weight of a 155mm M777. While the 105mm shells are smaller and pack far less of a punch than the longer-ranged 155mm projectiles, the little guns operate close to the front line, where defenses and jammers may make life a little harder for Russia’s fleet of artillery-hunting drones. Changing tactical circumstances can also force the guns to move about the battlefield. Conversely, 105mm gun crews, operating 10 miles from their targets, know they can be targeted by a wide array of Russian ordnance, so they may be incentivized to reflexively shoot-and-scoot. The French-built truck-mounted CAESAR 155mm gun has also done well in Ukraine. About 49 of these fast-moving, mobile guns are in Ukrainian service. And while the howitzers have been intensively used, they seem hard for Russia to catch. Open-source researchers have reported only two hits. Again, crew staffing these relatively un-armored gun carriages are incentivized to shoot-and-scoot. And, unlike Ukraine’s tracked self-propelled artillery, the wheeled howitzer—while it may not be as “mobile” as a tracked vehicle—is far harder for Russian analysts to track down. The German Panzerhaubitze (PzH) 2000 155mm self-propelled gun also seems to be avoiding harm. While the gun—the longest-range howitzer yet provided Ukraine—has suffered reliability problems and been forced to occasionally leave the battlefield for repairs, it has also been subject to high use-rates. Despite all the intensive use, only one of the 20 cannons has reportedly been damaged by Russian action. Again, this low loss rate may reflect the high-profile and specialized nature of the these platforms—making Ukraine focus on minimizing the risk to these hard-hitting, long-range platforms. Of course, open-source data is not the whole story. But the visual data available to date offers some compelling hints as to why Ukraine is losing some artillery platforms more than others. Given Ukraine’s massive losses of heavy towed 155mm guns, future Ukraine aid should focus on ensuring Ukraine retains sufficient mobility assets and enough fresh gun crews to keep their precious 155mm howitzers moving around the battlefield. If open-source data reflects a real trend, understanding the difference in loss-rates between the smaller 105mm gun and the big howitzers is important. Foreign observers can help Ukraine identify operational vulnerabilities faster, steering operators away from highly-used ammunition, refueling and firing positions before Russia has an opportunity to capitalize on Ukraine’s mistakes. With Ukraine challenged to hide tracked 155-mm self-propelled guns in the muddy Ukrainian fields, it might be worth comparing how the Ukraine army treats their fleet of workmanlike KRAB and M-109 guns versus how the Army operates their precious PzH-2000s. The loss rates may also reflect the challenge of adopting to a NATO-standard arsenal. While KRABs, M-109s and M777 howitzers look a lot like their old-school, Soviet-era analogues, they are very different animals, and need to be operated in different ways. New habits may come easier to those operators who are forced to operate platforms that have no simple Russian analogue. Mobility, of course, isn’t the only answer. Going forward, fancy technology and other efforts to block and jam Russia’s array of reconnaissance attack-drones will be critical. But the basics matter. The pattens seem clear: The more Ukraine’s high-value gear moves—and the more it moves in unpredictable patterns—the harder it is for Russia to hit them."
Constitution Meant For Article 370 To Be ‘Temporary’ Provision: Amit Shah,https://idrw.org/constitution-meant-for-article-370-to-be-temporary-provision-amit-shah/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The now-scrapped Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was meant to be a “temporary” provision since the beginning and the framers of the Constitution had put it there “intelligently”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Monday. Inaugurating a training programme on legislative drafting, Mr Shah also said that if a legislation is drafted well, there is “no need for any court to give any explanation to any law”. If the drafting is simple and clear, it will also be easier to educate people about the law with minimal chances of errors by the executive, he said and added that if “grey areas” are left in the drafting, they will lead to “encroachment” in interpretation. The home minister said if the drafting is complete and lucid, its interpretation will also be clear. Referring to Article 370, which the BJP government at the Centre repealed in 2019, the home minister said the whole country wanted that the provision of the Constitution should not be in existence. He also highlighted that when the Article was framed, it was mentioned in the index as “Temporary Provision of Article 370”. Even debates on the Article were missing from the records of constituent assembly debates, Mr Shah said and added that they were not printed. Mr Shah said it could well be imagined that whoever had drafted it and those who were part of the constituent assembly, how intelligently they put it and how after lots of thought the “temporary” word was inserted. “An article of the Constitution cannot be temporary, it can be amended. If you read it even today — the old Constitution, it is clearly written as Temporary Provision of Article 370,” he said. “Article 370 is no longer in existence. It has been repealed now. But please read it. It was mentioned in the index as ‘Temporary Provision of Article 370’. If this ‘temporary’ word was not written, what would have happened. Tell me, can a provision of the Constitution be ‘temporary’,” he asked. The Article was scrapped on August 5, 2019, a few months after Mr Shah took charge as the country’s home minister, and the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The home minister said that a “legislation should reflect the political will of the Cabinet or Parliament”. “A law becomes undisputed if it is simple and clear. It (a law) should be framed in a way that the court does not need to make any explanation. When there is no need for any court to give any explanation to any law, that is a medal for you. Our aim has to be to draft a law as simple and clear as possible,” the Union Home Minister said. When a law is made with ambiguities, it creates problems, the minister said and added that “if a law is made simple and clear, there is no need for the judiciary to intervene as grey areas leave scope for overstepping”. He said drafting of “the spirit of the legislature” is very significant work as simple translation is not sufficient and there has to be a proper explanation for it. The home minister said the drafting skill of those who work in the legislative wing of Parliament and of state legislatures should be improved because the world is changing very rapidly. Appreciating Parliament authorities for holding the training session, he said capacity building is very necessary and it has to be a continuous process. “We have to take proper action in this changing world and the laws have to be made according to today’s requirements. If we don’t have that kind of openness, we will be irrelevant,” said the BJP leader. The home minister also said the BJP government under PM Modi has made lots of changes in laws. “We have scrapped nearly 2,000 irrelevant laws. Also, we have not hesitated to frame new laws,” Mr Shah said."
Afghan Embassy In Delhi Rejects Claim Of Change In Leadership,https://idrw.org/afghan-embassy-in-delhi-rejects-claim-of-change-in-leadership/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: UNI The Afghanistani embassy in New Delhi has refuted claims of a leadership change following reports that the Taliban regime had replaced the Afghan Ambassador in the Indian capital. The Afghan news outlet, Khaama Press, had reported that Mohammad Qadir Shah was appointed by the Taliban foreign ministry in Kabul to lead the embassy in Delhi. However, embassy employees in the Indian capital strongly denied these claims and accused Shah of disseminating false information. In a statement released on Monday, the embassy clarified that it is taking a firm stance to safeguard the genuine interests of Afghan nationals. “The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan categorically rejects the claims made by an individual purporting to have taken charge of the mission in New Delhi on behalf of the Taliban administration,” stated the embassy. It then expressed gratitude to the Indian government for recognizing the plight of the Afghan people and refraining from acknowledging the Taliban regime. In August 2021, the Taliban regime seized control of Afghanistan through a devastating military coup, imposing severe restrictions on basic human rights, particularly women’s rights. The embassy further emphasized that the individual claiming to be the “charge d’affairs” appointed by the Taliban has been responsible for spreading misinformation and conducting a baseless campaign against embassy officials. The accusations, including unfounded allegations of corruption based on an unsigned letter, were deemed entirely fabricated by the embassy."

He did not specify the number of tanks to be ordered or the timeline for production. The Oplot is a Ukrainian main battle tank that was developed from its predecessor, the T-84, and entered service with the Ukrainian army in 2009. It features a combined protection system and anti-radar coverage, thermal imaging sights, an optoelectronic countermeasure complex, and a navigation system. The tank is equipped with a 125-mm smoothbore gun, a 7.62-mm coaxial machine gun, and a 12.7-mm anti-aircraft machine gun. It also has Ukrainian-made laser-guided missiles named “Kombat,” which can hit targets such as tanks, helicopters, and heavily fortified ground, surface, or low-flying targets at a range of up to 5 kilometers. The cost of one unit is approximately $4 million."
India-U.S. relations based on common desires of peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region: U.S. Ambassador Garcetti,https://idrw.org/india-u-s-relations-based-on-common-desires-of-peaceful-and-prosperous-indo-pacific-region-u-s-ambassador-garcetti/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The relationship between India and the United States is based on a common desire to have stronger economies and a peaceful, prosperous Indo-Pacific region, and the two countries stand together wherever it is challenged, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Monday. The two countries are an important part of a mutual strategy to protect the Indo-Pacific region and keep people safe, he said. Garcetti also said the two countries will deepen defence ties and work to develop things together in sectors like space and technology. Talking to reporters at the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad during his maiden visit to Gujarat, he said the place is important not just for Indian history but for the history of humanity. “Our relationship is not based on anyone else. It is based on each other, it is based on a warmth of friendship, and it’s based on a common desire to have stronger economies and a peaceful, prosperous Indo-Pacific region. Wherever that is challenged, we stand together,” Garcetti said. “We want to see stability in the neighbourhood–that’s important for India. But we also want to stand for the values that I think the Indo-Pacific region is strengthened by — freedom of movement and commerce, making sure we have a rule of law and people play by the same rules,” he said. Garcetti was responding to a question on China signalling backing the military establishment in Pakistan amid turmoil in the neighbouring country and the US investment in defence and space sectors in India. He said India and the US will continue to stand together for their respect to sovereignty and borders. The two countries will deepen defence ties and work to develop things together in sectors such as space and technology. “We want to see technology as a positive thing in people’s lives,” he said while citing the way electronic payments helped empower Indian people from the bottom-up. “We don’t see technology as being used against people from top down. I think there is a contrast where India and the US stand with other countries. But it is never about a third country. It is about us, and I would continue to emphasise this,” he said. On the issue of backlog of visas for Indian students seeking to study in the US, Garcetti said an effort is being made to reduce the wait time and the US Embassy will be able to process them and get to even higher numbers than last year. “My goal as an ambassador is to think of five years and 20 years from now. The president of the United States is very focussed on this too. He told me he wants us to focus on reducing visa wait times for not just students, but for first-time visitors and others,” he said. Garcetti said in the last three months, the wait time was brought down by 60 per cent from where they were in December. He said in the coming year, he will bring the wait time down. “Indian students are so great for America. They are great for our universities, they are great for our commerce. Look at the number of Indian-born CEOs of great companies based in America. It is good for the American economy, it’s great for the Indian economy, and it’s just good for civilisation too,” he said. Sharing his connection with India, Garcetti said he first came to the country when he was 14 years’ old. As a university student at 19, he started studying the teachings and writings of Mahatma Gandhi “and saw its potential to not only transform the world, but to inspire and touch our hearts.” “And today, while so much has changed since I was 19 years’ old, one thing that has not changed is the sense of connection I feel, not only to this place now and to the man who lived here with his family, but to the aspirations of the Indian people and the universal aspirations of all of us to live freely and to recognise the work of every human being,” he said. Apart from visits to the old city of Ahmedabad and the Sabarmati Ashram, Garcetti is scheduled to meet the state leadership and watch a T20 cricket match at the Narendra Modi Stadium here. He said this is an amazing moment in the US and India relations, a moment in which the two countries need to raise their ambitions. “It doesn’t matter where you come from, it does not matter who your parents are, it does not matter what religion you practice, it does not matter what language you speak–all that matters is the dreams in your hearts and working hard to achieve them. And those dreams of India are being realised every single day,” he said. Garcetti said when he came to India at the age 14, the trade between India and the US was just two billion dollars. “Today, it is over 100 billion dollars and it (US) is the number one trading partner with India. Back then, there were no defence cells, zero dollars, and now we are an important part of a mutual strategy to keep our people safe and protect the Indo-Pacific region together,” he said. Cultural exchanges and influence the people of the two countries have on one another through Hollywood, Bollywood and Tollywood show the rich and deep ties between the two countries, he said."
"Beneficiaries of old UN system oppose its reform, says EAM Jaishankar",https://idrw.org/beneficiaries-of-old-un-system-oppose-its-reform-says-eam-jaishankar/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: PTI External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has taken a dig at those opposing the UN reforms, saying those who are beneficiaries of the old system are resistant to that change as they feel it would “dilute” their positions of privilege. Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Sweden, interacted with the Indian community in this Scandinavian country on Sunday and highlighted the transformations underway in India during his visit to Stockholm for bilateral talks and the European Union (EU) Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum (EIPMF). Responding to a question if he sees any potential for India to become a permanent member of the Security Council, Jaishankar said that the effectiveness of the United Nations has come under question with each passing year and for the good, it should be reformed. “The UN was designed in the 1940s at a time when though India was an original signatory to the Charter, but India was not an independent country. And at that time the five countries who are still today permanent members of the Security Council, they kind of selected themselves,” he said. India has been at the forefront of the UN to push for an urgent long-pending reform of the Security Council. India has emphasised that it rightly deserves a place at the UN high table as a permanent member. The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the United States and these countries can veto any substantive resolution. There are also 10 elected non-permanent members who serve two-year terms. India completed its tenure as a non-permanent member of the Council in December last year. “Now, the problem today is like any, any institution, those who are previous beneficiaries are resistant to that change, which they feel would in some way, dilute the positions of privilege. Now, some of them may be more so some of them less so I think the wiser ones will say okay, life is changing. Let me change with it,” he said. He said that during the reform process, some countries will say it is useful for them to have a country like India, and there would be others who may not oppose the country openly but through their actions and policy would try to ensure that the status quo is maintained. He said reforming an organisation which has more than 190 nations as members is very hard. “So even sitting in the room to discuss it itself is a challenge,” he said. He said that reforms are needed as there is today no African country as a permanent member, there are no Latin American countries. “So, even for the good of the UN, it is so I’m not even taking an Indian viewpoint, I would say globally…For the good of the UN should be reformed,” he said. “But, you know, it will be kind of a tussle between the reformers and those who are obstructionist. But I’m pretty confident that with each passing year, I’ve seen the sentiment for reform grow stronger. So when it will happen, I can’t see but I can say the needle is moving in the direction of that,” he said. Speaking about the current geopolitical challenges facing the world, he said: “How the world looks depends in many ways where you’re located.”He said the Ukraine conflict is the most important event. The people in Asia to Latin America will experience different impacts. “It’s not like they, they are unaware of the seriousness of it. It is that it’s manifested in their lives in a very different way. So if you ask, say in Africa today, what is it which is really like you consider the life and death issue? You know, people will tell you to look, debt is a big issue. We don’t have the money to do education health, we are actually cutting back and in many ways, far from progressing,” he said. The Ukraine conflict has different impacts in different parts of the world. In some places it has expressed itself in food shortage, some countries found their energy bills shot up and there would be places where actually people would say they don’t have a fertilizer supply. Russia is one of the biggest, probably the biggest exporter of fertilizer. He said the disruptions caused by such events are one of the issues. “We don’t think of it as geopolitical, but it actually is,” he said. He also spoke about the big risk that can arise if the production is not dispersed, that if there’s a concentration in one area. Talking about technology, Jaishankar said the new technology is actually very, very strategic. “We are moving into a world where data, artificial intelligence, I mean, these are actually going to be the new expressions of power. When asked about how India is going to balance the trade with China while maintaining the security of the country, Jaishankar said when India embarked on the path of reforms in 1991-92, it did not give the kind of encouragement and support to manufacturing as given by China and Korea. “Now, what it did was, it actually put Indian industry, especially small industry, very much at a disadvantage, because, on the one hand, we were all exposing them to the world. But we were exposing them to economies where, in a sense, there are not a lot of non-market factors, subsidies at play, the scale was very different,” he said. Now the focus of the government is to motivate and encourage the revival of manufacturing. “I don’t want to be political abroad, but we have not always seen consistent support for industry and for manufacturing in India. But there is also the motivational factor. “There’s a lot of infrastructure, but there’s also that sense of having pride in being Indian of supporting your own or wanting your own companies to come. You know, that requires a certain I would say collective mindset,” he added. He said after the COVID pandemic and the disruptions caused by the Ukraine crisis, there is a sense in the world that there should be more sources of production. “And we are trying to position ourselves and trying to capture that sentiment and tell global companies saying, Look, why don’t you also look at India,” he said. On a question about India being less ambitious on its net zero targets, the minister said asking a society at USD 2,000 per capita income to even make a commitment, itself is a huge ask. “We should actually today look at a vision in a way you cannot equate India and the timelines of India and the growth path of India with countries that host per capita income of five times or 10 times or 20 times that of India,” he said, comparing it with China whose per capita income four and a half times of India. When asked about Indian culture going global, he said Indians abroad have a role to play in this. During his address, Jaishankar spoke about the transformations underway in India. He also spoke about India’s ties with Sweden. “Sweden has historically been an important partner. It has been an important partner when it comes to political relations,” he said. “When I say that political relations are good in practical terms, what it actually means is, you know, it could be the United Nations, it could be other international organisations. We tend to think along similar lines, we work together on important issues, we support each other…” he said. Jaishankar said Sweden has always been very sympathetic to what we call the Global South, the developing world. On the business part, almost 300 Swedish companies have a presence in India and there are several Indian firms operating in Sweden. He said this is not a good enough number given the growth rate in India. “..My approach is to build on what is actually more than a century-old tradition of business presence in India,” he said. He said Sweden is a very crucial Member of the European Union. The role and the weight of the influence of Sweden in the European Union is something which is of great value at a time when India is negotiating a free trade agreement with the bloc. “The second is when I look at the kind of, you know, challenges that India would contract in its own growth and development. Again, Sweden and its capabilities and its strengths fit in very strongly with that. He said the digital domain is the area where there are very strong possibilities of further collaboration between the two nations."
Army Chief Gen Manoj Pande leaves for Egypt,https://idrw.org/army-chief-gen-manoj-pande-leaves-for-egypt/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Chief of Army Staff Gen Manoj Pande on Monday left for a visit to Egypt to hold wide-ranging talks with the top military brass of the Arab country on enhancing bilateral defence relations. The Army said Gen Pande will interact with the Commander-in-Chief of Egyptian armed forces, defence minister and the Chief of Staff of the Egyptian armed forces. India is keen to expand strategic ties with Egypt, a key player in the politics of both the Arab world as well as Africa. It is also seen as a major gateway to markets in Africa and Europe. “Gen Manoj Pande, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) has proceeded on a visit to Egypt from May 16 to 17. During the visit, the Army Chief will be meeting the country’s senior military leadership where he will discuss avenues for further enhancing Indo-Egypt defence relations,” the Army said. It said the Army chief will also be visiting various establishments of the Egyptian armed forces and exchange ideas on issues of mutual interest. The military relations between India and Egypt are on an upswing and it was evident during the 74th Republic Day parade, wherein the Egyptian Armed Forces contingent made their first appearance. Egyptian President Abdeh Fattah El-Sisi was the Chief Guest at this year’s Republic Day parade. Notably, Indian and Egyptian Armies conducted the first ever joint exercise in January this year. “The visit of the COAS will further deepen the bilateral relationships between the two Armies and act as a catalyst for closer coordination and cooperation between the two countries on a host of strategic issues,” the Army said. Egypt has already shown interest in procuring Tejas light combat aircraft, radars, military helicopters and other platforms from India. The Egyptian side conveyed its keenness on acquiring the Indian platforms during delegation-level talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and El-Sisi during the Egyptian leader’s visit to New Delhi in January. In July last year, the IAF participated in a month-long tactical leadership programme in Egypt with three Su-30 MKI jets and two C-17 transport aircraft. In September, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh paid a three-day visit to Egypt."

Speaking at an event in Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra Rajnath Singh said there are some anti-India forces who are unable to digest India’s progress and strength. He added that since they do not have the strength to directly face India, they resort to proxy war like terrorism. He added that after the Uri and Pulwama incident, Armed Forces gave a strong message through surgical strikes and airstrikes that they are ready to fight and eliminate terrorism within the country or across the border. Mr Singh said Article 370 has been abrogated in Jammu and Kashmir and effective action has been taken against terrorism. The Defence Minister said securing borders, safety of the people and safeguarding the unity, integrity & sovereignty of the nation is the top priority of the government. Mr Singh said asserted that all efforts are being made to ensure that the country is protected from all kinds of threats. Talking about the growth in the defence sector, Mr Singh said, India is not only manufacturing defence equipment to cater to its own requirements but is also fulfilling the security needs of friendly countries. The Defence Minister stated that all sectors, including defence, have contributed in strengthening the country’s economy and it has become the fifth-largest economy in the world."

The total seizure has been confirmed as 2,525 kg and it is valued at 25,000 crore rupees, as per the official information received from the NCB. The officials further informed that the enumeration was completed in 23 hours. “The value became higher because it is higher grade methamphetamine. The seized drugs were in 134 sacks. The methamphetamine was kept in packets of one kilo each”, one of the officials said. One suspected Pakistani national was already arrested in this regard. He will be produced before the Court today evening, informed the NCB officials. On Saturday, NCB seized approximately 2,500 kg of contraband drugs in Indian waters in a special operation. Sanjay Kumar Singh, Deputy Director General (Ops) said it was the largest in terms of monetary value. Talking to ANI, Singh said, “NCB & Navy conducted a successful operation in the Indian Ocean. It is the largest in terms of its monetary value. It originated from the Chabahar port in Iran. The source of the drugs is Pakistan.” Singh further said that the consignment was meant for Sri Lanka, Maldives and India. “The mother ship was being stationed at different points in the sea. The smaller boats would go from various countries & collect consignments from the mother ships. The consignment was meant for Sri Lanka, Maldives and India. One Pakistani national has been arrested”, he said. He added that the operation was started in February last year and as part of the operation, the team has seized roughly around 4,000 kg of various drugs. “We started Operation Samudragupta in February 2022 as part of that operation we have seized roughly around 4,000 kg of various drugs”, Singh said. The initial success of the operation called ‘Samudragupta’ was achieved in the month of February 2022 when a joint team of NCB and Indian Navy seized 529 kg of Hashish, 221 kg of Methamphetamine and 13 kg of Heroin in the high seas off the coast of Gujarat, all sourced from Balochistan and Afghanistan.

Terror Funding Case: Anti Terror Agency Conducts Searches In Kashmir,https://idrw.org/terror-funding-case-anti-terror-agency-conducts-searches-in-kashmir/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday continued searches in Jammu and Kashmir in the case of terror funding by Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir– an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Earlier on May 11, the Central anti-terror agency carried out searches in Budgam and Baramulla districts of Jammu and Kashmir. The NIA on May 4 conducted searches at 16 places in Jammu and Kashmir as part of its continuing crackdown on terror funding in Jammu and Kashmir in the case related to separatist and secessionist activities of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat-e-Islami has been found carrying out terror funding activities in Jammu and Kashmir, even after being declared an unlawful association under the UA(P) Act on February 28, 2019. The NIA had filed a chargesheet in the case in a Special Court, Patiala House, New Delhi, on May 12, 2022, against four accused. It had earlier registered a suo motu case in the matter on February 5, 2021. On May 4, the NIA conducted searches at the premises of Jamaat-e-Islami (J&K) members and supporters at 16 locations, including 11 in District Baramulla in Kashmir valley and the remaining five located in District Kishtwar in Jammu region. Several incriminating materials and digital devices were seized during the searches and were being examined for more clues in the case. NIA investigations so far have revealed that Jamaat-e-Islami (J&K) members had been collecting funds domestically and from abroad through donations as well as for purported charitable purposes, such as promotion of education and health. “The funds were, instead, being used for violent and secessionist activities in J&K. They were also being channelled to proscribed terrorist organisations, such as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and others through well-organised networks of Jamaat-e-Islami cadres,” said the NIA. Further, as per the investigations, Jamaat-e-Islami was also engaged in motivating the impressionable youth of Kashmir and recruiting new members (Rukuns) in J&K for carrying out violent, disruptive, and secessionist activities. Previous investigations by the NIA had revealed that one of the four arrested accused, identified as Javaid Ahmad Lone, had been soliciting funds and organising meetings in the name of Jamaat-e-Islami (J&K). He had been delivering hateful anti-India speeches and exhorting people to make donations at these meetings. Along with Aadil Ahmad Lone, he had also acquired firearms and ammunition with ulterior motives from the other two accused, identified as Manzoor Ahmad Dar and Rameez Ahmad Kondu."

People familiar with the matter have told idrw that In addition to the engine itself, the deal is also said to include provisions for the establishment of a High Altitude Engine Test Facility (HAETF) and Flying Testbed Aircraft (FTB) in India, both of which will be provided or supported by the chosen aerospace engine OEMs. idrw has learned that the aerospace engine OEMs may directly provide or assist in setting up the High Altitude Engine Test Facility (HAETF) and Flying Testbed Aircraft (FTB) in India, as these facilities are critical for developing the engine locally and conducting all levels of testing during the development process. India’s goal is to avoid relying on OEM support repeatedly. DRDO is eager to include all necessary facilities to enable the local development of engines, including testing at all stages of development, to avoid the need for repeated external support. GTRE intends to produce 2-3 variations and variants of the same engine for other programs, and it is, therefore, crucial that the IPR of the engine remain in the country, for such programs to be executed domestically without external assistance."

In 2010, India’s Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) chose 99 F414 GE fighter jet engines to power the Mk II variant of the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) for the Indian Air Force. The initial batch of F414-GE-INS6 engines was to be supplied by GE Aviation under the terms of the original agreement, with the remainder being produced in India through a technology transfer agreement. At the time, the Indian Air Force was only interested in around 80 Mk II versions, which were to be built by re-engining the Tejas Mk1 airframe that was ready in 2014, with an All up weight (AUW) of 15 tons and an extended 500mm longer fuselage plug in its spine. However, by 2017, a new Mk II version with an All-up weight of 16 tons had been proposed, and in 2019, a final configuration with an All-up weight of 17.5 tons was approved by the Indian Air Force and ADA. The original deal had a limited level of technology transfer, with the Wet Section (after-burning module) being the only part of the engine to be assembled in India. The core section was to be assembled in a US facility before being shipped to India for final assembly. However, with the order book now expanding from 80-odd jets to a commitment of 108, with an additional 60-70 to be purchased at a later stage, India is looking to acquire almost 200 F414-GE-INS6 engines, which is twice the original order. As a result, India has insisted on a broader technology transfer agreement that includes the Dry section (Hot Section). This was agreed upon by GE Aviation and is expected to be approved by the US administration soon. India already has 16 F414-GE-INS6 engines, which were supplied by GE Aviation under the terms of the original contract and are intended for use on the Mk II prototype. Once the technology transfer is approved, India will negotiate a new contract with GE Aviation, taking into account inflation and technology transfer clauses. Meanwhile, the prototypes will use engines that have already been procured by HAL."

The state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) that has been exploring the concept of the Optionally-manned combat aircraft (OMCA), which involves converting retired jets into suicide drones for various purposes, such as carrying out attacks or baiting air defence positions within enemy airspace has been proposing making retired Mig-21s into OMCA. The OMCA project aims to develop platforms that can carry out auto take-off and landing without any remote pilot inputs and can be armed to carry out the first wave of airstrikes in heavily saturated airspace. However, the IAF is not fully on board with this project yet. People familiar with the matter have told idrw, that conversion of Mig-21 into OMCA would require the aircraft to be maintained in the same operational conditions as a piloted aircraft, leaving no room for compromise in its upkeep, since these aircraft are old, and spares are rare to come by as the IAF is now the oldest operator of the fleet type in the world, it might not be safe and will have limited utility. Instead, the IAF is reportedly considering cheaper unmanned combat platforms, such as the CATS Warrior, a Loyal Wingman concept from HAL, and Warrior 2, a light Unmanned Strike platform concept. HAL has been testing the OMCA concept on a Kiran Mk2, a Stage-II Trainer aircraft, and plans to demonstrate fully autonomous flight later this year to prove the basic concept of the platform."

Pakistan Military funds Khalistani Groups : Pakistani Retired Major,https://idrw.org/pakistan-military-funds-khalistani-groups-pakistani-retired-major/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: AFI A retired senior officer of the Pakistan Army, who has received multiple decorations for his service, has confirmed that the Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), have been involved in funding and supporting armed Khalistani groups in India. In addition, the ISI has been facilitating the entry of drugs and counterfeit Indian currency notes into India. On May 6, the chief of the Khalistani Commando Force, Paramjit Singh Panjwar, who had been given a new identity under the name of Malik Sardar Singh by the ISI, was gunned down in Lahore. In response to this event, Major (Retired) Aadil Farooq Raja, who has deep connections with the Army going back three generations and has a widely-followed YouTube channel, criticized the Pakistan military and the ISI for failing to protect Panjwar. According to Raja, the killing of Panjwar in the heart of Lahore was carried out by India’s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). He argued that the ISI should have done more to prevent this outcome and that the failure to do so exposed the inadequacies of Pakistan’s military and intelligence infrastructure. Raja’s comments highlight the complex and often tense relationship between Pakistan and India, which has been marked by a long-standing dispute over the territory of Kashmir and occasional outbreaks of violence. They also shed light on the extent to which the ISI has been involved in supporting Khalistani groups, a fact that is likely to further strain relations between the two countries."

He was attending the ‘Veer Shiromani Maharana Pratap Mahasammelan’ here in Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar in Maharashtra. Addressing the event, Singh said, “I never imagined this public who has come to listen to me, this is not a crowd it is a sea. I would congratulate you for changing the name to Sambhaji Nagar”. Urging people to know about history, he assured the people that neither did India ever bow down in the past nor will it ever do so in future. “One should turn over the pages of Maharana Pratap’s life, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. One will find that there is nothing more important than self-respect in human life,” Rajnath Singh said. He added, “In the war of Haldi Ghati, maharana Pratap did such wonders. I won’t get into the details…but I would say, whether it is Haldi Ghati or the Galwan Ghati, neither did India ever bow down nor will ever do so. I want to assure everybody of that”.

BRICS currency ‘plausible alternative’ to dollar hegemony,https://idrw.org/brics-currency-plausible-alternative-to-dollar-hegemony/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: GLOBAL TIMES Efforts by countries to replace the US dollar in international trade will reach a new high when BRICS nations discuss the feasibility of introducing a common currency at a summit in South Africa later this year, Chinese experts said on Sunday, noting that the move can be a fresh blow against the dollar’s hegemony. The BRICS group of nations will discuss the issue, which is likely be on the agenda of a meeting of the nations’ heads of state in Johannesburg on August 22, Bloomberg reported recently, citing the foreign minister of South Africa. The BRICS group of nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – accounts for one-third of global economic output, and their combined output is larger than the Group of Seven economies by some measures. Experts said the desire for a currency that offers better accessibility and fairer treatment in international trade is the main objective for BRICS nations. They pointed out that the US dollar, used as a tool for the US to exercise international hegemony, has caused great uncertainty for the recovery of the world economy. Zhou Yu, director of the Research Center of International Finance at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that the discussion is likely to be a probing effort by BRICS countries for a long-term goal of a currency unit. “Despite the daunting difficulties such an effort faces, it is not entirely impossible for these nations to have such a currency unit,” Zhou said. The creation of a unified currency for a group of countries usually takes a long time and requires years of cooperation, and eventually means phasing out local currencies, Zhou said, taking the birth of the euro as an example. “However, currently the effort by BRICS nations seems to be focused on devising a currency unit used specifically to settle cross-border trade, rather than a currency unit to replace other local currencies, which reduces the difficulty of such efforts and increases its plausibility,” Zhou said. The call from South Africa came amid a long list of calls and moves from BRICS countries or other emerging economies to shake off their reliance on the dollar. Countries are affected by US interest rate hikes and geopolitical conflicts as global trade priced in dollars is impeded. The freezing of Russian assets by the US and EU has also prompted countries to work on alternatives to treating the dollar as a reserve currency. Roughly 80 percent of global trade is currently settled in US dollars, according to media reports. During a trip to Spain in late April, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said that he supported creating a currency for trading among BRICS countries. Earlier in Shanghai, Lula questioned why countries should be tied to the dollar for trade, according to Reuters. Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday that the irresponsible monetary policy of the US has in recent years made the dollar full of risks. “An economy as large as China may be able to fend off some risks for its strong economic capacity, while some smaller countries may experience financial or debt crises,” Gao said. Zhou said local currency settlement, which has been seen growing rapidly in recent months, is now the concrete and major progress by BRICS countries to reduce the dollar’s dominance in trade settlement. More than 70 percent of China-Russia trade is already settled in local currencies, according to media reports. Last week, Brazil’s Suzano SA, the world’s biggest producer of hardwood pulp, said it may accept yuan for exports of its products to China, Bloomberg reported. Pakistan may also use the yuan to buy a shipment of Russian crude, a local news outlet reported. As the US Fed ends its rate hikes and the US dollar weakens as a result, the de-dollarization trend around the world will gain pace, Zhou said. Such developments will also speed up the pace of the yuan’s internationalization, experts noted. The BRICS countries have begun to increase their efforts to settle trade in other currencies, exemplified by the fast internationalization of the yuan, a more reliable currency, Gao said. Unlike the US’ excessive issuance of dollars, the Chinese government is responsible for the issuance of the yuan, Gao said, adding that increased local currency settlements will be a trend that will make trade between member countries fairer and easier."

Nepali Army procuring Chinese APCs with poor battlefield performance,https://idrw.org/nepali-army-procuring-chinese-apcs-with-poor-battlefield-performance/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The Nepali Army has begun the procurement process of acquiring weapons from a Chinese company that has been accused of providing inexpensive arms to South Asian and African nations, reported e-Pardafas. The report adds that the army will procure the arms from North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) without conducting any competitive bidding. The army has made the decision to purchase around USD 6 billion worth of weapons. The purchasing procedure has begun once a formal agreement was signed. Progress was achieved in obtaining 26 APCs, 72 tactical vehicles, and ammunition from China while Sher Bahadur Deuba was the former prime minister. Defence Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka seems uninformed of this development and is denying any involvement in the decision-making process on social media. There have been shortages of weaponry and equipment that other nations, including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Pakistan, had previously purchased from China. For instance, Bangladesh realised that the tank engines it had purchased from China in the years 2012-2013 were of substandard quality, e-Pardafas reported. The F-22P, which Pakistan’s Navy purchased from China, has also caused issues. Even Nepal has experienced difficulties, as the Nepal Airlines Corporation lost a lot of money because of issues with the planes it bought from China. According to reports, Lokendra Karki, a Nepali agent, is serving as a middleman to import weapons from China at a premium over the going rate. Lokendra Karki is the brother of Nepali Congress leader and former minister Gyanendra Bahadur Karki. Some senior Nepali Army officers are under suspicion for potential mismanagement and dishonesty in the acquisition of weapons in the context of the country’s unsteady political climate and the current period of transition. Military sources, cited by e-Pardafas, said that the Nepali Army is planning to purchase armoured personnel carriers (APCs) from China after being lured by the significant commission being provided by the Chinese government. The Nepali Army had previously procured weapons from Korea, but issues with the equipment led to their search for China. Notably, the Chinese company had earlier been represented in Nepal by Umesh Shrestha and Roshan Shrestha before Karki took over their role upon their expiration. Umesh Shrestha, the Nepali representative of the Norinco Company, has reportedly filed a complaint with the military headquarters, Bhadrakali, alleging that he was forced to resign from his position. Meanwhile, Karki, who was involved in the Nepali Army’s previous purchase of weapons from South Korea, has been holding secretive meetings with high-ranking officials such as Chief of Army Staff Prabhuram Sharma, Defense Minister Khadka, and representatives of Chinese arms companies, according to e-Pardafas. Sources mentioned by e-Pardafas indicate that Karki is actively involved in the procurement process and has been negotiating on Nepali Army’s behalf. Attempts to sell weapons to the Nepali Army have also been made by the South Korean business S&T Motive, but they have been unsuccessful in getting the military officials to agree to a commission of up to 50 per cent in exchange for buying their weaponry and arranging payment through a third country. The Nepali government has not yet decided whether or not to buy any weapons. Rekha Sharma, the minister of communication and information technology, said at a regular press conference that the Council of Ministers had not been informed of any decision to purchase guns from China and that no proposal had been made in this respect by the Ministry of Defence, e-Pardafas reported. The purchase procedure has advanced, and the Nepali Army has begun the second phase after completing the first phase’s payment process, despite Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’s interest in this matter. According to sources, Prabhuram Sharma, the chief of army staff, will soon travel to China. Additionally, Purna Bahadur Khadka, Nepal’s defence minister, and the Chinese ambassador to Nepal met last week. The Chief of Army Staff, according to reports, is in favour of an open procurement procedure, but other military officers are pressuring it to move forward, e-Pardafas reported. The army intends to buy additional Chinese weapons in the future; this is simply the first stage of the acquisition process. In terms of both military and economic cooperation with the Nepali Army, China seems to have made substantial advancements. Sources quoted by the e-Pardafas claim that after the Fast Track deal, a Major General in the Nepali Army who is connected to the former Chief of Army Staff, Purnachandra Thapa, bought the property in Dubai and Thailand. Furthermore, according to insiders, there are concerns over China’s expanding influence in the Nepalese army. According to sources, a letter was issued to the Military Welfare Fund to set up payment for the recent contract with the Chinese firm Norinco. The agreement involves the purchase of 26 Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) at a rate of USD 538,000 per unit, 94 tactical vehicles at USD 250,000 per unit, and thousands of 12.7 mm bullets. According to sources, a letter was sent to the Army Welfare Fund last week to arrange the contract amount with the Chinese company for the purchase of Chinese weapons. It is believed that the fund is exploring the possibility of arranging payment through Himalayan Bank or Rashtra Bank and is preparing to make the payment for the purchase of weapons this week, e-Pardafas reported."

Now, it has not paid any attention to Pakistan’s tantrums, which it has thrown ahead of the G20 meeting slated to be held in Srinagar on May 23 and 24 this year. Pertinently, India’s independent foreign policy even earned appreciation from a detractor like former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan. Khan praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led regime for taking the decisions in the interest of its citizens. He announced that Pakistan was a slave to the West and was unable to take fearless decisions for the welfare of its citizens. It may be recalled that when Narendra Modi took over the reins of the country in 2014, he had promised to the nation that India would emerge as one of the most powerful countries in the world. He has remained true to his word. He has worked relentlessly to put India on the top. Imran Khan was ruling Pakistan when the PM Modi-led regime on August 5, 2019, announced its decision to scrap J&K’s special status and bifurcate it into two Union Territories. Imran Khan knocked the door of every country, including the Islamic nations, to put pressure on India to reverse its decision but all the countries closed the doors on Khan by making it clear to him that they cannot interfere in India’s internal matters. Khan had to return dejected. He realized that India has defeated Pakistan diplomatically as the entire world endorses India’s stand and respects its decisions. G20 summit in Srinagar Exactly three years after revoking the Article 370, PM Modi led dispensation announced it would hold a G20 summit in Srinagar, summer capital of J&K. Pakistan once again opposed the decision by throwing tantrums. It called on the G20 countries not to attend the meetings to be held in Srinagar as “J&K is a disputed territory”, but none of the G20 countries paid any heed towards the hue and cry raised by Pakistan. They confirmed their participation in the tourism working group meeting scheduled to be held in Srinagar on May 23 and 24 this year and ignored the Kashmir rant of India’s unruly neighbour. India respects the sovereignty of all India’s independent foreign policy has made it clear to the world that it respects the sovereignty of all the countries and won’t allow any other nation to disturb peace in its territory. It’s in place to mention here that Jammu and Kashmir had remained a challenge for all the regimes that came into power in New Delhi after 1947. No government was able to merge J&K completely with the Union of India which led to Article 370 remaining in vogue for seven long decades. However, the PM Modi-led regime “bit the bullet” and ended J&K’s 70-year long status-quo. In his first in the office from 2014 to 2019, Prime Minister Modi did a complete homework on J&K and soon after assuming power for the second term in 2019 it ended all the confusions and ambiguities surrounding J&K. World support The international community has supported all the moves of PM Modi-led regime and has lauded its zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism. As of date the entire world is supporting India in its war against terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. It has rejected Pakistan’s propaganda and has backed India. During the past nine-years, Pakistan has been exposed. Entire world is aware of the fact that Pakistan is a breeding ground for terror and it grooms terrorists in its backyard. New Delhi has been nice with the nice people and has pushed back difficult people. The Gulf countries coming forward to invest in Jammu and Kashmir is yet another example of India’s successful foreign policy. The Gulf countries by deciding to invest billions of dollars in J&K have sent a clear message to Pakistan that they have full faith in India and its policies. Multiple challenges The PM Modi-led regime has faced multiple challenges vis-a-vis J&K, but it has put in all the efforts to instill a sense of confidence, to give that sense of hope, and security to J&K people and the foreign investors. After 2019 things have changed for the better in J&K. Economy has grown, new employment opportunities have been created. Entire ecosystem has become vibrant despite Pakistan making desperate attempts to disturb the peace. On the diplomatic front, India has taken a lead by making the world aware about its clear and transparent policies. The world has understood that India is a progressive nation and its emerging as the fifth largest economy in the world is ample proof of the fact that it’s in the right hands. In the 9-years of PM Modi’s rule India has driven home a point that no one can take the country for granted. Talks and terror cannot go together. People are the fountainhead of power and their interests are supreme. Soft approach abandoned New Delhi has given up its apologetic and soft approach. By carrying out surgical strikes in 2016 and Balakot airstrikes in 2019, India gave a befitting reply to terrorists that they cannot intrude into J&K and get away with their acts. It’s not only Imran Khan who has praised India’s foreign policy, the entire world has lauded the efforts of the present regime in India, and many leaders have gone on record to say that they are “impressed”. Many nations are following the footsteps of India and are keen on making their relationships stronger with New Delhi. India not an aggressor The PM Modi-led regime has made the world understand that India is not an aggressor but it cannot tolerate aggression. India after attaining G20 Presidency last year has ensured that representatives of the most powerful countries in the world, who attend the summit, should know that India stands for peace, tranquility and development and wants all the countries to prosper. New Delhi’s decision to host one of the G20 meetings in Srinagar has put the summer capital of J&K on the global map and has sent a message to the world that Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a conflict zone. Pakistan sponsored terrorism has ended and people are living their lives peacefully."

In return, they would be paid by some Pakistani agents based in India. They were also in touch with a female PIO agent who was arrested last year in an Official Secrets Act and Honey-Trap case in Rajasthan,” Odisha STF said in a statement. “Based on the intelligence input Odisha STF apprehended three accused persons from Nayagarh and Jajpur District and they have been identified as Pathanisamant Lenka, (35) works as ITI Teacher, Saroj Kumar Nayak, (26) and Soumya Pattanaik, (19)” STF said. During raids, various incriminating materials such as 19 mobile phones, 47 pre-activated SIM Cards, 61 ATM cards, 23 SIM covers and laptops were seized from their possession. These OTPs were then used to create various accounts and channels on social media like Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook and Instagram and also on online shopping sites like Amazon and Flipkart. These are also used in opening email accounts. People will think that these accounts are owned by an Indian but actually operated from Pakistan. These social media platforms will be used for various kinds of Anti-India activities like Spying, communication with terrorists, radicalization, running anti-India propaganda, fuelling anti-India/ divisive sentiments on social media, sextortion, Honey-trapping etc. As these accounts are registered and linked to Indian mobile numbers people find it trustworthy. The accounts opened on online shopping platforms are also used to supply items to terrorists, anti-India elements etc. Apart from these, they were also creating and selling mule accounts through social media groups, which are used in various crimes."

The crops were sown after India and Pakistan agreed on a ceasefire in 2021. Farm Manager Dr Rakesh Khanjuria told PTI, ”For the first time, wheat crops were grown on these farmlands. Harvesting is going on in full swing.” He added that 70 per cent of the farmland has been harvested. The Agriculture department’s Seed Multiplication Farm is spread on nearly 1,000 acres on two sides of the border fencing in the Chakrohi-Jorafarm belt about 40 kilometres from Jammu. The farm, one of the biggest seed multiplication farms in the Union Territory, is said to grow the best seeds of wheat, basmati, oil, fodder and vegetables. ”This is the first time in 25 years that fertile land lying ahead of the fencing up to the zero-line has been cultivated and the crops due to peace in the border belts,” Khanjuria said. The Agriculture department and the Border Security Force are overseeing the farming activity. ”While wheat is being harvested on 815 acres on this side of the fencing, this is the first time in decades that the crop is being grown on over 50 acres,” he said. Harvest from the 50 acres has already passed the 2,000-kilogramme mark, Khanjuria said."
EAM discusses transformations underway in India with Indians in Sweden,https://idrw.org/eam-discusses-transformations-underway-in-india-with-indians-in-sweden/,"May 15, 2023","SOURCE: ANI External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday (local time) interacted with the Indian diaspora in Sweden and discussed transformations underway in India. He also apprised them about the progress in bilateral relationship with Sweden on the 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two nations. “Delighted to interact with the Indian Community in Sweden. Apprised them of the progress in our bilateral relationship as we mark 75 years of diplomatic ties. Sweden is valued as a member of the EU, a Nordic partner and a fellow multilateralist. Spoke about the transformations underway in India that enhance our global profile and create opportunities for Indians abroad,” tweeted Jaishankar. Diplomatic relations between Sweden and India were established in 1948, a year after India became independent. During the 2018 visit of Prime Minister Modi to Sweden, the two sides adopted a wide-ranging Joint Action Plan and signed a Joint Innovation Partnership. The first high-level Dialogue on Innovation Policy was co-chaired by Prime Minister Modi and the King of Sweden in December 2019. PM Lofven was the Chief Guest at the 2016 Make in India event and Sweden hosted a major Make in India event in 2017. Earlier Jaishankar met Sweden’s Defence Minister Pal Jonson and Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom during his three-day visit to Sweden. Taking to Twitter, Jaishankar said, “Good to meet Defence Minister Pal Jonson of Sweden. Useful exchange of views on regional and global security.” After meeting his Swedish counterpart, Jaishankar said that both countries are committed to taking bilateral cooperation to a higher level. Both nations had exchanged views on the Indo-Pacific, the European strategic situation and de-risking the global economy. “Wide-ranging discussions with FM @TobiasBillstrom as India and Sweden mark 75 years of diplomatic ties,” Jaishankar said in another tweet. Jaishankar is on a three-day visit to Sweden to participate in the EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial. He is also expected to attend the inaugural session of the India Trilateral Forum involving India, Europe, and the US, with his Swedish counterpart Tobias Billstrom. In addition, Jaishankar will discuss India-EU relations during his visit as Sweden currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. At the EU-India Pacific Ministerial Forum, Jaishankar laid stress on the multipolar world. “The Indo-Pacific is a complex and differentiated landscape that is best understood through more intensive engagement. A generous and strategic approach that caters to economic asymmetries will surely enhance the EU’s appeal. The more European Union and Indo-Pacific deal with each other, the stronger will be their respective appreciation of multi-polarity. And remember, a multipolar world, which the EU prefers, is feasible only by a multipolar Asia,” said Jaishankar. He said that the EU has major stakes in Indo-Pacific developments, especially concerning technology, connectivity, trade and finance. Jaishankar dealt with globalisation and established thinking at the forum. “Globalization is the overwhelming reality of our times. However, far apart, regions and nations cannot be impervious to significant events elsewhere. Nor can we cherry-pick them to our convenience. The European Union has major stakes in Indo-Pacific developments, especially as they pertain to technology, connectivity, trade and finance. It has to, in respect for, and observance of UNCLOS. Agnosticism on such matters is therefore no longer an option,” he said."
HAL to Replace Aluminum Control Rods on ALH-Dhruv with Steel Ones,https://idrw.org/hal-to-replace-aluminum-control-rods-on-alh-dhruv-with-steel-ones/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: API Following multiple reports of Aluminum Control Rods wearing out prematurely on the ALH-Dhruv platform, HAL has decided to replace them with steel ones. The ALH-Dhruv had been largely grounded after a Navy chopper crashed, and subsequent tests revealed control rod issues in many of the helicopters. After investigations, it was determined that they could fly for 100 hours before being tested again. HAL officials have now stated that the replacement program will begin soon, with the new steel control rods expected to be easier to maintain. The replacement process is anticipated to take about a year. Despite being acceptable to the armed forces, the ALH-Dhruv has been plagued by control rod problems. However, with the introduction of the new steel control rods, these issues may become a thing of the past. This decision comes after multiple accounts of early fatigue in the aluminum control rods, causing them to wear out before completing their engineered life. HAL officials have said that the new steel control rods will offer a better lifespan and increase the reliability of the platform. The replacement program is expected to address the problems faced by operators of the ALH-Dhruv platform and ensure that the platform performs as per the expectations of the armed forces."

According to the Indian Embassy in Sudan, the body was brought to India in a C-17 Airforce evacuation aircraft. Albert Augustine was hit by a stray bullet and succumbed to his injuries on April 15, 2023. Congress MP from Kerala’s Kannur, K Sudhakaran, on April 16 wrote to External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar requesting his urgent intervention to repatriate the body of his constituent Albert Augustine who lost his life amid the ongoing violent conflict in Sudan. Earlier on April 16, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar expressed grief over the death of Albert Augustine, who worked at a Dal Group Company in Sudan’s Khartoum. Taking to Twitter, Mr Jaishankar said, “Deeply grieved to learn about the death of an Indian national in Khartoum. The Embassy is making all efforts to extend fullest assistance to the family. The situation in Khartoum remains one of great concern. We will continue to monitor developments.” Sharing details about the Indian national, the Indian Embassy in Sudan tweeted then, “It has been reported that Mr Albert Augestine, an Indian National working in a Dal Group Company in Sudan who got hit by a stray bullet yesterday succumbed to his injuries. The embassy is in touch with family and medical authorities to make further arrangements.” Heavy gunfire and blasts were reported following days of tension between the armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which has claimed at least 56 lives and left around 595 people, including combatants, injured, reported Al Jazeera. The two sides have been competing for power as political factions negotiate on forming a transitional government after a 2021 military coup. The tensions stem from a disagreement between the military, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, about how the paramilitary force should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee that process, according to Al Jazeera. The military, 18 months after its coup, had promised to cede control to a civilian-led government this month. Yet, the process has been dominated by a rivalry between General al-Burhan and General Hamdan, also known as Hemeti. The two generals have been openly criticizing one another in speeches over the past few months, and they have dispatched reinforcements and armoured vehicles to oppose military camps spread around the city. Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Sudan urged Indians, planning a trip to Sudan, to postpone their plans. The Indian embassy has issued an appeal to countrymen to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan. In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, “Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates.” The embassy’s warning came in light of clashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces."

The upcoming meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden holds the potential for significant developments, one of which could be the contract on the MQ-9B Predator deal. The meeting, expected to address a range of bilateral issues, may pave the way for the finalization of this crucial defence agreement. The Indian Armed Forces have formulated a plan to acquire 18 MQ-9B Predator drones in a deal worth $1.8 billion. As part of this agreement, the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, and Indian Navy will each receive six drones, each equipped with various sensory payloads. In an additional boost to India’s Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) and High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Class Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) programs, General Atomics, the manufacturer of the MQ-9B Predator, intends to locally manufacture some of the drone’s components, contributing to the global supply chain. The MQ-9B Predator, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is renowned for its advanced surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. India has expressed interest in procuring these drones from the United States to bolster its defence capabilities and enhance border surveillance in sensitive regions. However, it is important to note that defence deals involve complex negotiations and considerations. While the meeting between Modi and Biden may provide a conducive environment for discussions on the MQ-9B Predator deal, the finalization of the contract would require careful deliberations and adherence to regulatory processes."
ARDC issues tender for Canard control surface bearings of LCA AF Mk2,https://idrw.org/ardc-issues-tender-for-canard-control-surface-bearings-of-lca-af-mk2/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: API The Aircraft Research & Design Centre (ARDC) of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has issued a tender for the supply of bearings required for the Canard control surface of LCA AF Mk2 A/c. This report outlines the technical specifications of the bearings and additional requirements related to their installation, removal, and qualification. Vendor Qualification Criteria: To qualify for the tender, vendors must have designed, developed, and supplied similar canard bearings to reputed aerospace organizations in the last five years. Documentary evidence must be provided by the vendor along with the technical bid. Start-ups and MSEs are not eligible for any relaxation in the above criteria, as the canard bearings are used in the supply line of safety-critical units of the aircraft. Description: The Canard assembly of the LCA AF Mk2 A/c is supported by two housing brackets on the fuselage structure. Bearings are installed at each fuselage bracket interface with the canard shaft to enable unrestricted operation of the control surface as defined by its flight envelope. The layout of the canard assembly with support brackets and bearings is shown in Figure 1 for reference. The bearings must meet performance and loading requirements without periodic maintenance. The number of cycles given under dynamic loading is estimated for a minimum of 2000 hours of operating life. However, efforts should be made to achieve twice or thrice the number of cycles given (operating life) to enable continuous use of the bearings without replacement throughout the entire life of the aircraft. The bearing design should conform to AS 81820 or EN 2755 aerospace standards wherever applicable. The wear on the PTFE liner should be within acceptable limits as per design standards. In summary, HAL’s ARDC has issued a tender for canard control surface bearings for LCA AF Mk2 A/c that meets strict vendor qualification criteria, conforms to aerospace standards, and is designed for long-lasting, maintenance-free performance."

The ministry on Sunday said the aim of the move is in sync with the government’s overall aim to promote ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) in defence production. It is the fourth such “positive indigenisation list (PIL)” comprising line replacement units, sub-systems and components used for various military platforms, equipment and weapons. “To promote ‘Aatmanirbharta’ in defence and minimise imports by defence public sector undertakings, the Ministry of Defence has approved fourth Positive Indigenisation List (PIL) of 928 strategically-important line replacement units/sub-systems/spares and components, including high-end materials and spares, with import substitution value worth ? 715 crore,” the ministry said in a statement. The aim of the indigenisation list is to minimise imports by the defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs). The defence ministry has set specific timelines for import ban of the items, spanning the period from December 2023 to December 2028. This list is in continuation to the three similar PILs that were brought out in December 2021, March 2022 and August 2022. “These lists contain 2,500 items which are already indigenised and 1,238 (351+107+780) items which will be indigenised within the given timelines,” the ministry said. Of 1,238, 310 items have been indigenised so far, it said. The items which were already indigenised comprised 262 from the first PIL, 11 from the second list and 37 from the third PIL, according to the ministry. “The DPSUs will undertake indigenisation of these items through different routes under ‘Make’ category and in-house development through the capabilities of MSMEs and private Indian industry, thereby providing impetus to the growth in economy, enhanced investment in defence and reduction in import dependence of DPSUs,” the ministry said. “In addition, this will augment the design capabilities of the domestic defence industry by involving academia and research institutions,” it said. The ministry said DPSUs will soon initiate procurement action for these notified items. In the last few years, the government has taken a series of measures to promote the domestic defence production. India is one of the largest importers of arms globally. According to estimates, Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement over the next five years. The government now wants to reduce dependence on imported military platforms and has decided to support domestic defence manufacturing. The defence ministry has set a goal of a turnover of USD 25 billion (Rs 1.75 lakh crore) in defence manufacturing in the next five years which includes an export target of USD 5 billion worth of military hardware."

PM Modi said India wants normal bilateral ties with Pakistan, adding that “it is incumbent upon them to create a conducive environment free from terrorism and hostilities. The onus is on Pakistan to take necessary steps in this regard”. India has repeatedly raised its concern over Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism and has asserted that terror and talks cannot go together. Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto had attended the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Goa earlier this month but there were no bilateral talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. PM Modi’s interview to Nikkei Asia, which is part of Nikkei, one of Asia’s largest independent business media groups, has come ahead of G7 Summit in Japan, happening at a time of increasing global challenges. During the interview, the Prime Minister also answered queries related to ties with China and spoke about India’s efforts to amplify the voices and concerns of the Global South. “India is fully prepared and committed to protect its sovereignty and dignity,” PM Modi said. A standoff erupted with China in Eastern Ladakh in the summer of 2020 following actions of the Chinese army and while talks have led to disengagement from some areas, some friction points remain. “Peace and tranquillity in the border areas are essential for normal bilateral ties with China. The future development of India-China relationship can only be based on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests,” PM Modi said, noting that “normalizing” the ties would benefit the wider region and the world. PM Modi on Friday reached Hiroshima in Japan to attend the G7 Summit. India has been invited as a guest country for the Summit. India has been participating in the G7 Summit since 2003. Asked whether India can play a mediator role in Russia-Ukraine conflict, PM Modi said his country’s position on the Ukraine conflict “is clear and unwavering.” “India stands on the side of peace and will remain firmly there. We are committed to supporting those who face challenges in meeting their basic needs, especially in the face of rising costs of food, fuel, and fertilizers. We maintain communication with both Russia and Ukraine,” PM Modi said, adding that “cooperation and collaboration should define our times, not conflict”. PM Modi said that Japan and India’s shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law have naturally brought them closer. “We now see a growing convergence in our political, strategic, security, and economic interests,” he said in the interview, which was conducted partly in writing and partly in person. PM Modi also vowed to “amplify the voices and concerns of the Global South” nations at the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, as he strives to “foster synergy” with the broader Group of 20. India holds G20 presidency and will host the summit later this year. PM Modi told Nikkei Asia that he was looking forward to discussing global changes and challenges in areas such as energy, digital technology and supply chains. “I will emphasize India’s role as a reliable partner in addressing these challenges,” he said, adding that India’s experience would “resonate strongly at the meeting.”"

Mr Mufti was speaking to PTI-video on the preparations for the G-20 grouping meeting on tourism in Srinagar from May 22 to 24. Amid strain in ties India-Pakistan ties, the biennial SAARC summits have not taken place since the 2014 meeting in Kathmandu. “We don’t live close to Australia, America or Japan which are members of G-20. We are living in this region and the SAARC caters to the problems of this region and if the government takes the initiative and has a summit of SAARC countries and addresses the problems that are being faced by this region including what is happening in Pakistan” that will help India to be the leader in the region and the world, she said. But the government “has to understand that the road leads through SAARC and not through G-20”, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief said. The G-20 event will be the first international meeting being held in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh — in August 2019. “As far as G-20 is concerned, it has been made into a BJP event because even the logo has been replaced by a lotus. It may be a kind of good promotion for the party itself and as far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, especially the Valley you have seen the way the crackdowns are going on…,” she said. However, the Jammu and Kashmir police denied any high-handedness saying that only those people against whom there is digital evidence of indulging in anti-national activities have been detained. Ms Mufti said that G-20 “may be a good PR exercise for BJP at international level but it is not going to make India the ‘Vishwaguru’ which they talk about”. It is the SAARC and if the leadership here takes an initiative to have a SAARC summit “that is something that can really establish the leadership of India in this region and ultimately it can establish its leadership in the world,” she opined. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), set up in December 1985, is a grouping of eight countries — India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The last planned summit scheduled to be held in Islamabad on November 15-19 in 2016 was called off as India expressed its inability to participate due to “prevailing circumstances” following a terror attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir. Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan had also declined to participate. Kashmir will be hosting the third G-20 tourism working group meeting from May 22 and 24. The first working group meeting on tourism was held at Rann of Kutch in Gujarat in February and the second one at Siliguri in West Bengal in April. Even as authorities have spruced up the city for the event, Ms Mufti claimed that the roads of Srinagar have been “destroyed in a brutal way” and the “heritage stones have all been uprooted and replaced by some cheap kind of tiles, public toilet tiles.” While fiercely criticising the BJP, Ms Mufti maintains that PDP allying with the saffron party in 2014 to form the government was not a mistake She stressed that her father and former Union home minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed wanted to safeguard Article 370, land and employment rights for the people of Jammu and Kashmir” and that is why he took a “bold step” and put everything at risk “including his credibility, his party, and his politics for a larger cause at stake”. “And today when we see the way they have dismantled everything, they have scrapped Article 370 unconstitutionally, it proved that my father was right in reaching out, engaging the BJP for a larger cause,” she said. Today, however, she feels that the gulf between Srinagar and New Delhi has not only expanded but “it has gone beyond repair”. She also said the conditions in J-K were “a far cry” from being conducive for holding elections. Asked about her views on the resumption of India-Pakistan dialogue and the situation in Pakistan, she said, “Why should they (India) decide to talk this time when they know Pakistan is in shambles. I mean, they know when to talk. They are much wiser than you and me.” She said that the judiciary and the media in Pakistan are “in a better form than in many other places in the world”. “I think Pakistan is in shambles and there are no two opinions about that, but there is a saving grace that is the judiciary and the media. They are holding the system accountable and that is something that may save the country ultimately,” she said. To a question about Pakistan pushing its agenda of terrorism in India, she said it is condemnable. On the Karnataka poll results, she said the people have “rejected the divisive agenda of the ruling party who even brought deities like Lord Hanuman into the narrative and talked about not needing Muslim votes”. “I salute the people of Karnataka that they have shown wisdom and voted on issues that are unemployment, inflation, and other problems. That is a good sign and I hope this is something that is carried forward even during parliamentary elections next year,” she` said. Ms Mufti again batted for Opposition unity. “If we have to save the country, we have to save the democracy in the country, we have to save the Constitution of this country, and for that, all the parties have to forget their differences and come together that is the most important thing to do if we want the idea of India to survive,” she said."
"“Multipolar World Feasible Is Only By Multipolar Asia,” Says S Jaishankar",https://idrw.org/multipolar-world-feasible-is-only-by-multipolar-asia-says-s-jaishankar-2/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: ANI External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday (local time) laid stress on the multipolar world at the EU-Indo-Pacific Ministerial. “The Indo-Pacific is a complex and differentiated landscape that is best understood through more intensive engagement. A generous and strategic approach that caters to economic asymmetries will surely enhance the EU’s appeal. The more European Union and Indo-Pacific deal with each other, the stronger will be their respective appreciation of multi-polarity. And remember, a multipolar world, which the EU prefers, is feasible only by a multipolar Asia,” said Mr Jaishankar. He made the remarks while sharing his thoughts about the Indo-Pacific at the EU-India Pacific Ministerial Forum. Mr Jaishankar outlined six points reflecting capabilities, activities and endeavours among the nations of the Indo-Pacific. He said that the EU has major stakes in Indo-Pacific developments, especially concerning technology, connectivity, trade and finance. Jaishankar dealt with globalisation and established thinking at the forum. “Globalization is the overwhelming reality of our times. However, far apart, regions and nations cannot be impervious to significant events elsewhere. Nor can we cherry-pick them to our convenience. The European Union has major stakes in Indo-Pacific developments, especially as they pertain to technology, connectivity, trade and finance. It has to, in respect for, and observance of UNCLOS. Agnosticism on such matters is therefore no longer an option,” he said. Mr Jaishankar said that the artificial lines that separated theatres due to the politics of the day are now coming to terms with a more integrated existence. They also reflect different capabilities, broader activities and shared endeavours among the nations of the Indo-Pacific. Mr Jaishankar said that established thinking is being tested by the outcomes of the last two decades. “How to respond to non-market economics is proving to be a formidable challenge than most expected. The compulsions of the immediate are often in contradiction with the concerns of the medium-term. Therefore, conventional templates must give way to new thinking better suited to emerging realities,” said Mr Jaishankar. Indo-Pacific itself is increasingly central to the direction of global politics. Among the issues that it throws up, are the problems inherent in the established model of globalization. The EAM said that recent events have highlighted the problems with economic concentration, as also the need for diversification. “De-risking the global economy now involves both, more reliable and resilient supply chains, as well as promoting trust and transparency in the digital domain. EU and indeed the world is better off with additional drivers of production and growth,” he said. Mr Jaishankar said that transformations underway in India, like digital public delivery or green growth initiatives, merit the EU’s attention. India’s rapidly expanding global footprint will intersect with the EU more in the coming years. “In such an engagement with the Indo-Pacific, the EU will naturally seek like-minded partners. India is certainly among them. There may be historical and cultural divergences but at the end of the day, we are political democracies, market economies and pluralistic societies,” he said. Jaishankar while further evaluating Indo-Pacific laid stress on Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD), commonly known as the Quad, a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan and the US. “Any evaluation of the Indo-Pacific will naturally factor in the Quad as a platform for global good. The agenda and the impact of the Quad have steadily expanded. I would also highlight the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and the Maritime Domain Awareness initiatives as having potential significance. From an Indian perspective, let me also flag the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) we proposed in 2019. The EU will be comfortable with its objectives and may consider partnering in one of its pillars,” said Mr Jaishankar. He also underscored that India and the EU need a regular, comprehensive and candid dialogue, especially with regard to the Indo-Pacific."
‘Matter of concern for security of the state’: SC on ISRO scientist’s unauthorised association with,https://idrw.org/matter-of-concern-for-security-of-the-state-sc-on-isro-scientists-unauthorised-association-with/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: IANS The Supreme Court has upheld the dismissal of an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist — an expert on starting and transient flows in the solid rocket motors — for his unauthorised association with foreign institution, especially in the area of propulsion, which is a strategic research and development subject in the organization. A bench of Justices M.R. Shah and C.T. Ravikumar said it is not the mere unauthorised absence of the appellant that actually weighed with the authority and evidently, the organisation is perfectly justified in casting suspicion on the honesty, integrity, reliability, dependability, and trustworthiness in view of the factual situation. Justice Ravikumar, who authored the judgment on behalf of the bench, said the Centre’s stand that his unauthorised association with foreign institution, especially in the area of propulsion, which is a strategic research and development subject in the organisation and based on which the nation’s rocketry and ambitious launch vehicle programs are/were advancing, was a matter of concern for the security of the state. “When such acts/conduct occur/occurs from a scientist in a sensitive and strategic organisation, the decision to impose dismissal from service cannot be said to be illegal or absolutely unwarranted,” he said in the judgment delivered on Friday. The bench said that the continued association with a foreign agency/university, ignoring the fact that he is a responsible scientist in the ISRO, which is a highly sensitive and strategic research and development organisation under the Department of Space, if viewed suspiciously and thought that his further exposure to ISRO’s critical rocket technologies would create serious complications. “It cannot be said to be bereft of substance and not a matter of concern in regard to the security of the state,” it said. The bench said it does not find any reason to hold that the judgment of the Kerala High Court, dismissing the challenge against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), warrants any kind of interference in exercise of the power under Article 136 of the Constitution. “The appeal, therefore, must fail and accordingly it is dismissed, however, without any cost,” said the bench. Dr V.R. Sanal Kumar moved the apex court challenging the high court judgment delivered in January 2012, which dismissed his challenge against September 30, 2008 order of CAT. Kumar was initially appointed as Scientist/Engineer ‘SC’ in Group-A in Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram of ISRO on January 15, 1992. On July 1, 1999, he was promoted as Scientist/Engineer ‘SD’. On August 28, 2002, he was invited by Prof. H.D. Kim, Head of School of Mechanical Engineering, Andong National University, South Korea, to join as a postdoctoral trainee and to assist him for one year, recognising the appellant as a well-known expert on the starting and transient flows in the solid rocket motors. Kumar applied for leave, which was not approved, however he went to South Korea. The appellant, through an email on September 5, 2003, was informed that his leave was not sanctioned and he was required to report for duty not later than September 11, 2003. Meanwhile, the respondent organisation came to know he had published a technical paper as first author with a foreigner as one of the co-authors in the 39th American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Joint Propulsion Conference, US held during July, 2003, without obtaining specific approval of the competent authority. Thereupon, disciplinary action was initiated against him and he was charge-sheeted on December 19, 2003, for unauthorised absence and publication of papers without following due procedure or obtaining approval. The appellant claimed he is a high-profile scientist with specialisation in rocket propulsion with proven credentials at par with NASA scientists. Kumar said that he is second to none in space programme and is having all potential to become the Chairman of ISRO and is the best suitable candidate for the post with immediate effect. The bench said there can be no doubt that the appellant has been working under ISRO since 1992, and he has gained sufficient experience on the subject. “leaving to a foreign country without prior permission and continuing there for a considerable long period despite advice and instructions to come back and continuing to associate with such a foreign organisation/university researching on rocketry, the respondent organisation cannot be said to have committed a flaw or fault in entertaining suspicion on his honesty, integrity, reliability, dependability and trustworthiness and above all to treat such acts as a matter of concern in relation to the security of the State,” said the bench. The bench also said the court cannot judge on the expediency or inexpediency to dispense with the inquiry as it was arrived at based on the subjective satisfaction of the President based on materials. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, representing the appellant, submitted that he was dismissed without inquiry in the manner provided under the Central Civil Services Rules. On behalf of the Centre, advocate Shailesh Madiyal submitted that ISRO employees are not allowed to go abroad and to take up assignments or research there, without permission."
"“Should understand what happened in East Pakistan, the atrocities committed”: Imran Khan",https://idrw.org/should-understand-what-happened-in-east-pakistan-the-atrocities-committed-imran-khan/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Former Pakistan Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan while addressing the nation on Saturday said people should understand the atrocities committed in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). “Today, we should understand what happened in East Pakistan and the atrocities committed. The party there which won a majority and should have been Prime Minister, was denied their right,” the PTI chief said. “We lost half the country. We cannot imagine the damage done to the country. Because people make decisions behind closed doors, a handful of people that don’t know how the rest of the world is operating, make decisions,” Khan said. The PTI chief further said: “They don’t even allow people to assess the damage done because of their decisions. When the Hamoodur Commission Report was written, it was never published and after 25 years, it was published in India. This is not how counties function.” Khan said he wants to remind people about East Pakistan. He said it happened during his lifetime, in March 1971. “I went to play a match in East Pakistan against the U-19 team. Ours was the last flight out of East Pakistan. I still remember the hate people had towards East Pakistan. We were ignorant of what was happening because the media was controlled as it is today. The difference is, we, have social media today. And they shut down social media as well,” Khan said. “Because they wanted to promote their own narrative, that those protesting are rioters, they shut down social media, Facebook, Twitter, internet services. We can’t imagine the damage to the country’s economy. So, this is what happened in East Pakistan,” he added. On March 25, 1971, Pakistan Army launched ‘Operation Searchlight’, wherein a planned military operation was carried out by the Pakistani Army and its military which deliberately harmed hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi citizens. According to The Friday Times, the 1971 genocide was destructive to Pakistan’s reputation. Pakistan’s generals however still don’t recognize the mass massacre they sponsored 50 years ago. West Pakistan under the leadership of General Tikka Khan and General Khan Niazi, was responsible for the deaths of over three million Bengalis, and the rape of some 400,000 women across the region."
Pak Army’s image takes beating as crowds ransack military property,https://idrw.org/pak-armys-image-takes-beating-as-crowds-ransack-military-property/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: IANS The inability of the security agencies for whatever reason to protect the symbols of the military might such as the GHQ, the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence and other properties has also dented the image of the Pakistan military’s invincibility, media reported. Though the period between the arrest and release has highlighted the deepening political polarisation in the country, some experts believe that the events of May 9 — which was declared as history’s dark chapter by the army — will have a negative impact on the PTI-establishment relationship, The Express Tribune reported. Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob feels that “the events of May 9 following the arrest of Imran Khan would have profound and adverse impact on the future relationship of the establishment and the PTI”. The Pildat chief said the rampage of PTI supporters and their attack on military installations and properties will eventually harm the public standing of the party, The Express Tribune reported. “Unless the perpetrators are quickly identified, prosecuted and punished, the wounds inflicted on May 9 will not heal,” he said. The Pakistan Army has entered the fray with an unprecedented challenge to the leader of a political party, writes Pakistan author F.S. Aijazuddin in Dawn. Aijazuddin wrote that the ISPR explicitly warned PTI leader Imran Khan. It advised “the political leader concerned to make a recourse to legal avenues and stop making false allegations”. Failing that, “the institution reserves the right to take legal course of action against patently false and malafide statements and propaganda.” Khan retorted that his accusations targeted individuals, not the institution per se. This clarification was not nearly enough. “Orders were issu­ed, presumably at the highest level within the powers that be and are, to arrest Imran Khan. On May 9, the Pakistani public witnessed for the umpteenth time the unedifying spectacle of yet another political leader being manhandled into a Black Maria for incarceration,” he wrote. “The backlash this time has been fierce. Images are being circulated on social media of attacks on GHQ and the house of the Lahore Corps Commander in flames. Both appeared unguarded. Their gates opened at the sight of a mob,” Aijazuddin wrote. Baqir Sajjad, Pakistan Fellow at Wilson Centre said on the Supreme Court for Imran Khan’s release said, “New definition for ‘release’ would have to be crafted. He is technically free man, but practically in custody and permitted to meet few people, who have been cleared. But I agree that not only today’s development, but whatsoever happened over past few days has been setback for the Army.” “When and where premises of military installations and Commanders’ houses were last breached by protesters. No one would dare even go to Rawalpindi’s Mall Road to stage a protest. That’s definitely nothing to be proud of, but it is a major change that has taken place,” Sajjad added. Director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre, Michael Kugelman, termed the arrest a “huge escalation in a long, ugly crisis”. He also pointed out that the arrest came following Imran’s reiteration of allegations against military officials, Dawn reported. “There are clear indications that there is a lack of agreement within the Army on the proper way forward,” Kugelman says, BBC reported. “My sense is that the senior-most Army leadership would be happy not to see him involved in politics any more, whereas many elements in the lower and middle ranks of the Army are big supporters of Khan. Khan has polarised politics, he’s polarised the public and he’s polarised the Army as well, which is a difficult feat to pull off.” As per the ISPR’s statement — detailed, pointed, no-holds-barred — protests “targeting Army property and installations” were part of a well-thought-out plan targeting the Army. The scenes that were witnessed on Tuesday (May 9) were indeed disturbing. PTI protesters ransacked, vandalised and even set on fire some public and private property. That they were able to set fire to the Corps Commander House in Lahore and enter territory belonging to key Army installations made for visuals that were deeply disturbing to the image of the state, The News said in an editorial. No wonder even PTI leaders were soon seen distancing themselves from these mobs. More than a hundred police officers were injured in Punjab and over a dozen in Peshawar as well. “The ISPR has said that this “group in political garb” has done what the country’s enemies could not do in 75 years, all in its “lust for power” and that the “Army showed patience and restraint and exercised extreme tolerance” despite knowing the orders, directives and complete pre-planning (were) by some sinister party leadership,” The News said. Since Tuesday, there had been murmurings about why and how the scale of protests had been ‘allowed’ to go on. The ISPR statement may have also been meant to put an end to the scores of social media forwards that have relentlessly talked about internal breakdowns, martial laws, coups and what not. There was a flurry of ‘audio leaks’ — a very Pakistani political tool that comes in handy at extremely convenient times — that seemed to suggest that these violent attacks and protests were pre-planned by the PTI. Some PTI leaders were arrested yesterday and political observers say that a crackdown is imminent in the wake of the alleged audios, The News said. The optics of Army installations being targeted or military officers homes being ransacked did no favour to the PTI. If rumours are to be believed, there is a chance the party may face a ‘ban’ though some observers say this step will be quite drastic, The News said. Pakistan is teetering after former Prime Minister Imran Khan was dramatically arrested by paramilitary troops on corruption charges, sparking a deadly outpouring of anger against the powerful military that has put the country on edge, CNN reported. Unrest has spread across multiple major cities, resulting in unprecedented scenes of defiant crowds breaking into military properties and setting the homes of Army personnel ablaze, directly challenging a usually untouchable force that has long sat at the apex of power in Pakistan, CNN reported. Since it won Independence in 1947, Pakistan has struggled with political instability, regime changes and coups with the military having a historically decisive role in who stays in power."

"Govt to roll out lost mobile blocking, tracking system pan-India on May 17",https://idrw.org/govt-to-roll-out-lost-mobile-blocking-tracking-system-pan-india-on-may-17/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: PTI People will be able to block and track their lost or stolen mobile phones across India with the rollout of a tracking system by the government this week, a senior government official said. Technology development body Centre for Department of Telematics (CDoT) has been running the pilot of the CEIR system in some of the telecom circles, including Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and North East region, and the system is now ready for pan-India deployment, a DoT official, who did not wish to be identified, told PTI. “The CEIR system is scheduled for pan-India launch on May 17,” the official said. When contacted, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Project Board at CDoT Rajkumar Upadhyay did not confirm the date but confirmed that the technology is ready for pan-India deployment. “The system is ready and now it will be deployed across India in this quarter. This will enable people to block and track their lost mobile phones,” Upadhyay said. CDoT has been able to add features to check the use of cloned mobile phones across all telecom networks. The government has made it mandatory to disclose IMEI—a 15-digit unique numeric identifier—of mobile devices before their sale in India. The mobile networks will have access to the list of approved IMEI numbers which will check the entry of any unauthorised mobile phones on their network. Telecom operators and CEIR system will have visibility into IMEI number of the device and mobile number linked to it, and the information is being used in some states to track your lost or stolen mobiles through CEIR. “One of the common practices is that miscreants change IMEI number of stolen mobile phones which prevents tracking and blocking of such handsets. It was a national security issue. The CEIR will be able to block any cloned mobile phones on the network with the help of various databases,” Upadhyay said. The basic purpose of CEIR is to ease reporting of stolen and lost mobiles and block the use of mobiles all over the country. This will discourage the theft of mobile phones, enable the tracing of the stolen and lost mobiles to the police, detection of cloned or counterfeit mobiles, restrict the use of such cloned mobiles, as well as protect the interest of the consumers by making them aware of the information related to fake and cloned mobile phones. Recently, Karnataka Police recovered and handed over more than 2,500 lost mobile phones to their owners using the CEIR system. Apple already has a system to track lost mobile phones with the help of Apple ID but major issues have been around Android mobile phones. With the new system in place, it will be futile to use stolen mobile phones. “The system has an in-built mechanism which will also check the smuggling of phones and help the government from revenue loss to the exchequer as well,” Upadhyay added."

Machine guns are mounted in the doorframes of these helicopters to provide fire support during special heli-borne operations such as airborne assault, troop insertion, or search and rescue missions in hostile territories. Such situations make the gunner vulnerable to enemy ground fire, and the Kevlar safety screens will offer much-needed protection. The development of Kevlar screens is considered a critical component, as they are required to be effective in various operational environments and at temperatures ranging from minus 40 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius. Kevlar is a lightweight and strong fibre that has various industrial applications, including the manufacturing of bullet-resistant equipment such as personal armor and ballistic shields. Its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio makes it five times stronger than steel, making it an ideal choice for protection against gunfire. The IAF has proposed that special safety screens be designed for the Mark-III version of the Dhruv helicopter. The screens must be able to withstand the rigors of operational use, and the project team is working to ensure that they are effective in all scenarios. The screens will be an essential addition to the safety equipment on board transport helicopters, and their development is being given utmost priority by the IAF."

The spokesperson, Tanveer Ahmad Rather, urged the Indian Army to listen carefully, claiming that men, women, and even elderly individuals were expressing a persistent desire to carry out attacks. The leaflet stated that while the group had not agreed to such actions in the past, the time was near when they would carry out their plans for “Fire And Fury” on the army bases. According to sources, Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) affiliated People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) is facing pressure from Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI to carry out high-profile attacks on Indian Army bases before the G20 meeting in Srinagar. The ISI has been pushing for the cancellation of the meeting, but their attempts have failed to gain traction. This development comes in the wake of the Pulwama attack that took place on February 14, 2019. In that attack, a Jaish suicide bomber, Adil Ahmad Dar, rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into an Indian Army convoy, resulting in the deaths of 40 CRPF personnel. The Indian government has been taking measures to prevent such attacks and ensure the safety of its armed forces."

Army commanders to get meteorological app for operations,https://idrw.org/army-commanders-to-get-meteorological-app-for-operations/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: UNI The Indian Army is all set to launch the Anuman app on May 19, which has been designed and developed to provide detailed weather projections for the army’s deployments along the China border. The app has been developed in collaboration with the National Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), and will be launched by Indian Army Vice Chief Lt Gen MV Suchindra Kumar in the national capital. Under the MoU signed between the Indian Army and NCMRWF on November 24, 2022, the former will provide NCMRWF with a collection of observations along the Northern borders, and in turn, receive customized products for higher-resolution weather forecasts for its components along the borders with China. The app is critical since the meteorological inputs for the commanders in the field have a greater significance, helping them plan and carry out operations effectively. The Artillery units use them on a regular basis to “temper its weapon platforms before firing projectiles through the earth’s atmosphere”. NCMRWF’s data has previously helped artillery fire more accurately. It is also worth mentioning that the Indian Army is observing 2023 as the ‘Year of Transformation’ and is working on several technology-driven projects, such as a battlefield surveillance system, Situational Awareness Module for the Army, Situational Reporting Over Enterprise-Class GIS Platform (E-Sitrep), Project Avagat, Project Indra, among others, aimed at enhancing the force’s capabilities. According to a senior Indian Army official, automation in the force is a continuous process that keeps evolving with technology, and a number of secure automation projects are underway to increase the digital footprint of the Indian Army, with the ultimate aim of simplifying systems, processes, and functions to enhance operational and functional efficiency."

Dorji expressed hope that the dispute would be resolved soon, especially since they had signed a three-step approach to tackle the problem the previous year. He also stated that there is peace and tranquility along the border, and that the demarcation of the border would happen soon. Furthermore, Dorji mentioned that the Chinese have always respected Bhutanese territory, and that there have been no instances of them encroaching on Bhutanese land. On the other hand, India and Bhutan are the only two neighboring countries that have yet to finalize their boundaries, and two recent talks between the Indian and Chinese Foreign Ministers had made no headway on the border dispute. This is in contrast to China’s other 12 land neighbors who have already settled their boundaries.

"“Multipolar World Feasible Is Only By Multipolar Asia,” Says S Jaishankar",https://idrw.org/multipolar-world-feasible-is-only-by-multipolar-asia-says-s-jaishankar/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: ani External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday (local time) laid stress on the multipolar world at the EU-Indo-Pacific Ministerial. “The Indo-Pacific is a complex and differentiated landscape that is best understood through more intensive engagement. A generous and strategic approach that caters to economic asymmetries will surely enhance the EU’s appeal. The more European Union and Indo-Pacific deal with each other, the stronger will be their respective appreciation of multi-polarity. And remember, a multipolar world, which the EU prefers, is feasible only by a multipolar Asia,” said Mr Jaishankar. He made the remarks while sharing his thoughts about the Indo-Pacific at the EU-India Pacific Ministerial Forum. Mr Jaishankar outlined six points reflecting capabilities, activities and endeavours among the nations of the Indo-Pacific. He said that the EU has major stakes in Indo-Pacific developments, especially concerning technology, connectivity, trade and finance. Jaishankar dealt with globalisation and established thinking at the forum. “Globalization is the overwhelming reality of our times. However, far apart, regions and nations cannot be impervious to significant events elsewhere. Nor can we cherry-pick them to our convenience. The European Union has major stakes in Indo-Pacific developments, especially as they pertain to technology, connectivity, trade and finance. It has to, in respect for, and observance of UNCLOS. Agnosticism on such matters is therefore no longer an option,” he said. Mr Jaishankar said that the artificial lines that separated theatres due to the politics of the day are now coming to terms with a more integrated existence. They also reflect different capabilities, broader activities and shared endeavours among the nations of the Indo-Pacific. Mr Jaishankar said that established thinking is being tested by the outcomes of the last two decades. “How to respond to non-market economics is proving to be a formidable challenge than most expected. The compulsions of the immediate are often in contradiction with the concerns of the medium-term. Therefore, conventional templates must give way to new thinking better suited to emerging realities,” said Mr Jaishankar. Indo-Pacific itself is increasingly central to the direction of global politics. Among the issues that it throws up, are the problems inherent in the established model of globalization. The EAM said that recent events have highlighted the problems with economic concentration, as also the need for diversification. “De-risking the global economy now involves both, more reliable and resilient supply chains, as well as promoting trust and transparency in the digital domain. EU and indeed the world is better off with additional drivers of production and growth,” he said. Mr Jaishankar said that transformations underway in India, like digital public delivery or green growth initiatives, merit the EU’s attention. India’s rapidly expanding global footprint will intersect with the EU more in the coming years. “In such an engagement with the Indo-Pacific, the EU will naturally seek like-minded partners. India is certainly among them. There may be historical and cultural divergences but at the end of the day, we are political democracies, market economies and pluralistic societies,” he said. Jaishankar while further evaluating Indo-Pacific laid stress on Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD), commonly known as the Quad, a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan and the US. “Any evaluation of the Indo-Pacific will naturally factor in the Quad as a platform for global good. The agenda and the impact of the Quad have steadily expanded. I would also highlight the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and the Maritime Domain Awareness initiatives as having potential significance. From an Indian perspective, let me also flag the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) we proposed in 2019. The EU will be comfortable with its objectives and may consider partnering in one of its pillars,” said Mr Jaishankar. He also underscored that India and the EU need a regular, comprehensive and candid dialogue, especially with regard to the Indo-Pacific."
"India Plans Repatriation of Kohinoor, Colonial Artefacts from UK: Report",https://idrw.org/india-plans-repatriation-of-kohinoor-colonial-artefacts-from-uk-report/,"May 14, 2023","SOURCE: PTI India is planning a repatriation campaign for artefacts dating back to the colonial era, including the controversial Kohinoor diamond and other idols and sculptures in museums across the UK, according to a British media report on Saturday. “The Daily Telegraph” newspaper claims the issue is among the priorities of the Narendra Modi-led government, with it likely to spill over into diplomatic and trade talks between the two countries. While the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is said to be leading efforts to reclaim objects “trafficked” out of the country since independence, officials in New Delhi are believed to be coordinating with diplomats in London to make formal requests to institutions holding artefacts seized as “spoils of war” or collected by enthusiasts during colonial rule. “The long work of repatriation will begin with what is considered the easiest targets, small museums and private collectors, who may be more willing to voluntarily hand over Indian artefacts, and then efforts will turn to larger institutions and Royal collections,” the newspaper report said. Senior officials in New Delhi believe that such historical artefacts can reinforce a strong national cultural identity, with Lily Pandeya, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, quoted as saying: “Antiquities have both physical and intangible value, they are part of the continuity of cultural heritage, of community and national identity. artefacts, you are robbing this value, and breaking the continuity of knowledge and community.” The Kohinoor, also known as Koh-i-Noor or mountain of light in Persian, was in the spotlight at last week’s Coronation with Queen Camilla averting a diplomatic row by choosing alternative diamonds for her consort’s crown. The 105-carat diamond was held by rulers in India before landing in the hands of the East India Company from Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s treasury and then being presented to Queen Victoria following the annexation of Punjab. “The return of such a historically significant artefact would be ‘deeply symbolic,’ according to ministerial circles in New Delhi, and there is understood to be a political will to achieve such a symbolic post-colonial victory,” the report said. The British Museum could face claims for its collection of Hindu statues and the Amaravati Marbles, which were taken from a Buddhist stupa by civil servant Sir Walter Elliot and the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Indian collection could also be subject to claims. The newspaper describes this drive to reclaim Indian artefacts as a “reckoning” with the country’s colonial past, with Secretary for the Indian Ministry of Culture Govind Mohan being quoted as saying that returning antiquities would form a key part of India’s policy-making. “It is of huge importance to the government. The thrust of this effort to repatriate India’s artefacts comes from the personal commitment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made it a major priority,” the newspaper quoted Mohan as saying. There have been other cultural trends in recent years toward repatriation, with Greece seeking the Elgin Marbles and Nigeria the Benin Bronzes. Last year, Glasgow Life – a charitable organisation which runs the Scottish city’s museums – signed an agreement with the Indian government to repatriate seven stolen artefacts to India. Most of these objects were removed from temples and shrines in different states in northern India during the 19th century, while one was purchased following a theft from the owner. All seven artefacts were gifted to Glasgow’s collections, according to Glasgow Life. In New Delhi, a senior official of the ASI said concerted efforts are being made to repatriate artefacts from out of the country. “Since Independence, 251 artefacts have been brought back to India, and 238 of these have been repatriated since 238,” ASI spokesperson Vasant Swarnkar said. “Besides, about 100 artefacts are in the process of being repatriated, from countries including the UK, and the US,” he told PTI. Antiquities in India are governed by The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, which state that “it shall not be lawful for any person, other than the Central Government or any authority or agency authorised by the Central Government in this behalf, to export any antiquity or art treasure…”."

According to a recent news report in India, the Indian Air Force (IAF) is said to be interested in acquiring the ORCA (Omni Role Combat Aircraft), which is the proposed Air Force variant of the Indian Navy’s TEDBF (Twin-Engine Deck-Based Fighter) platform. The procurement is expected to take place from 2026 onwards, following the completion of the ORCA’s first flight. However, reliable sources have confirmed that while the proposal exists, the IAF is currently more focused on supporting the development of the Tejas MkII and AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft) to rejuvenate its modernization plans. The IAF intends to prioritize the procurement of these indigenous fighter aircraft before considering the Navy-led fighter jet program, which could be fulfilled by the Tejas MkII and AMCA. The TEDBF program, primarily funded by the Navy, has a current order book of 45 units, which is expected to rise to 100 units by 2040. TEDBF is touted as a near fifth-generation fighter program, awaiting clearance from the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to secure funds of approximately 13,000 crores. This amount is nearly equivalent to the 15,000 crores requested for the AMCA program. The IAF’s procurement plans include acquiring 180 Tejas MkII and 120 AMCA aircraft, along with an additional 50 Tejas Mk1A aircraft, in addition to the 73 jets already on order with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The IAF aims to streamline its fleet by reducing the number of different types of fighter jets to 5-6. Although the IAF has shown limited interest in the Navy’s TEDBF program, the Navy has agreed to procure approximately 100 units to make the project commercially viable for its three aircraft carriers’ operations. Overall, the IAF’s immediate focus appears to be on supporting the development of indigenous fighter aircraft like the Tejas MkII and AMCA, while the Navy is proceeding with its TEDBF program to cater to its specific operational requirements."

The NCB said it was the largest seizure of methamphetamine in the country and a Pakistani national has been detained in connection with it. Giving details of the seizure at a press conference held, NCB Deputy Director General (Ops) Sanjay Kumar Singh said it was carried out as part of ‘Operation Samudragupt’ which targeted maritime trafficking of drugs originating from Afghanistan. This is the third major seizure by NCB of maritime trafficking of drugs through the southern route in the last one and a half years, the agency said. As part of the operation, so far around 3,200 kg of methamphetamine, 500 kg of heroin and 529 kg of hashish has been seized, it said. The first seizure in the operation was made in February 2022 when a joint team of NCB and Indian Navy seized 529 kg of hashish, 221 kg of methamphetamine and 13 kg of heroin from the high seas off the coast of Gujarat, all sourced from Baluchistan (a region in Pakistan) and Afghanistan, the agency said. Subsequently, an Iranian boat was intercepted off the coast of Kerala in a joint operation by NCB and Indian Navy in October 2022 and a total of 200 kg of high-grade heroin, also sourced from Afghanistan, was seized and six Iranian drug traffickers were arrested, it said. Thereafter, sharing of real-time actionable information, generated during the operation, with Sri Lanka and Maldives led to the seizure of hundreds of kilograms of heroin and methamphetamine and arrest of 19 drug traffickers in two operations conducted by the Sri Lankan Navy in December 2022 and April 2023, the agency said. The agency claimed that the latest consignment of around 2,500 kg of methamphetamine was meant for India, Sri Lanka and Maldives from Afghanistan. The drug cache had started on a “mother ship” – a large vessel that distributes narcotics to various boats during its journey – from the Makran coast around Pakistan and Iran, it said.

The mission was the longest one yet for this new space plane, which had previously spent just two days in orbit, according to Andrew Jones, a journalist specializing in China’s space program. Despite the lengthy duration of the recent flight, China has released very little information about the space plane’s objectives, specifications, or activities in orbit. In a brief announcement, Chinese state news agency Xinhua hailed the mission as a breakthrough in the country’s research on reusable spacecraft technology, which it said would enable more affordable and convenient methods of space travel in the future. The manufacturer of the space plane, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC), echoed Xinhua’s statement on the social media platform Weixin. Xinhua reported that the experimental spacecraft landed at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China. However, orbital tracking data and satellite imagery suggest that the landing actually took place at the Lop Nur military base in the neighboring province of Xinjiang, according to Jones. Despite the lack of information, Chinese state media touted the event as a significant milestone in the country’s space program. Reports noted that the spaceplane’s journey was much shorter than the US X-37B, which spent a record 908 days in orbit. The Warzone reported that data from private space services company LeoLabs suggests that China’s mini spaceplane docked with or captured a smaller object multiple times during its 276-day space mission. The mini spaceplane also demonstrated formation flying and raised its altitude through multiple large maneuvers, in addition to what appeared to be two or three docking or capture missions."
US Government Supports Boeing’s Super Hornet Proposal to India,https://idrw.org/us-government-supports-boeings-super-hornet-proposal-to-india/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: API. The upcoming months of June and July are poised to be significant for the United States and France, as both nations are set to receive Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the state level. During his visits, there is anticipation that an announcement may be made regarding the winner of the Indian Navy’s fighter jet competition between Boeing and Dassault. The aerospace industry is eagerly awaiting a decision. The Indian Navy has announced its decision to hand over the final verdict on the selection of the next generation fighter jets to the Government of India. Both the Rafale M by Dassault and the Super Hornet by Boeing have been deemed to meet the Navy’s technical criteria, making it difficult for the Navy to make a clear-cut choice between the two. The US administration is actively supporting Boeing’s efforts to secure India’s first-ever fighter jet contract. The Indian government is facing pressure from the US to select the F-18 as its deck-based fighter aircraft, in part due to the assistance that the US Navy has provided in the development of India’s Aviation Trial Regiment. The US Navy’s experience could be critical in helping India develop larger aircraft carriers equipped with an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), which may require additional support from the US. The Rafale M holds an edge due to its commonality with the existing Rafale fleet of the Indian Air Force, but the Navy has left the decision up to the government, which is expected to make a well-informed choice based on strategic and diplomatic considerations. This development comes after months of intense evaluation and scrutiny of the two aircraft by the Indian Navy, which had to assess various factors such as technical capabilities, pricing, after-sales support, and the transfer of technology. The Rafale M, a naval variant of the Rafale, has already been inducted into the French Navy, making it a proven and battle-tested platform. On the other hand, the Super Hornet has been in service with the US Navy for decades, with a proven track record of reliability and versatility. With both aircraft meeting the Navy’s technical requirements, the decision to hand over the final verdict to the Government of India underscores the complexity of the selection process and the strategic importance of the decision. It is now up to the government to evaluate all relevant factors, including geopolitical considerations and the long-term impact on the country’s military capabilities, before making a final call. The decision is expected to be a significant milestone for India’s defence industry and the country’s strategic partnerships with France and the US."
Indian Navy invites domestic firms for collaboration in developing flight-critical systems,https://idrw.org/indian-navy-invites-domestic-firms-for-collaboration-in-developing-flight-critical-systems/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: API. Rear Admiral Deepak Bansal, the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Air Materials, recently spoke about the Indian Navy’s plans to collaborate with capable industry partners to produce more flight-critical and mission-critical components. In a report by “The Hindu,” he explained that flight-critical items are crucial for the safety of the entire aircraft, and there are only a few such items that the Navy has been able to indigenize so far. Speaking on the sidelines of a Naval Aviation Industry Outreach Programme held at Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) trade fair complex in Coimbatore, Rear Admiral Bansal emphasized the importance of building more of these critical components in India. He also mentioned that mission-critical components are not as vital as flight-critical components, as their failure would lead to mission failure rather than endangering the aircraft. On the other hand, non-flight-critical components include support equipment like jacks, platforms, towing arms, trolleys, and so on. According to Rear Admiral Bansal, the Navy is currently focusing on producing non-flight-critical items as they are easier to manufacture locally. Overall, the Indian Navy is seeking capable industry partners to collaborate and develop critical components that are essential for the safety and success of its aircraft. This initiative will not only boost the indigenization of defense manufacturing in India but also create more opportunities for local industries to participate in the country’s defense sector."

India-backed port opens in Myanmar in answer to China’s corridor project,https://idrw.org/india-backed-port-opens-in-myanmar-in-answer-to-chinas-corridor-project/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: ANI A new port in Myanmar built with assistance from New Delhi has begun to receive container ships as both India and China seek closer economic ties with the Southeast Asian country Myanmar, Nikkei Asia reported. The first cargo vessel from the Indian metropolis of Kolkata arrived Tuesday at Sittwe Port in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Officials from India and Myanmar’s military government attended the port’s inauguration ceremony. Sittwe Port forms a link in India’s Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, a sea lane connecting Kolkata in eastern India to Sittwe on Myanmar’s western coast. From there, the corridor traces an inland route through Myanmar via the Kaladan River and a highway, crossing into northeastern India, Asia Nikkei reported. Ahead of the ceremony, Indian shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal hailed the port as “unlocking [India’s] northeast for Southeast Asia.” The two countries shook hands on the USD 484 million Kaladan project in 2008. New Delhi is providing support across the board, Asia Nikkei reported. New Delhi sees the new Kaladan project as a way to connect isolated northeastern India to the Indian Ocean, providing a catalyst for economic growth. The region is linked to the rest of India by only the narrow Siliguri Corridor, a bottleneck squeezed by neighbouring countries with China looming to the north. Northeast India has witnessed ethnic conflict as well as deadly border clashes between Indian and Chinese troops, Asia Nikkei reported. While India has called for the return to civilian rule in Myanmar, New Delhi has maintained a close relationship with the military government since it took control in 2021 and has distanced itself from Western sanctions. Myanmar shares a border with India, and the two countries need to cooperate in responding to cross-border militant groups and other challenges, said a diplomatic source, Asia Nikkei reported. China also seeks access to the Indian Ocean through Myanmar. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met on May 2 with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who leads Myanmar’s military government. Qin said Beijing will accelerate the development of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which has logistics and industrial infrastructure projects connecting China to the Indian Ocean, Asia Nikkei reported. China plans a large port and an industrial zone in Kyaukpyu, a town in Rakhine state. Though Sittwe Port has opened, construction on other parts of the Kaladan transport corridor including highways has been stalled by fighting between Myanmar’s military and pro-democracy factions. The Indian Council of World Affairs, a think tank linked to India’s foreign ministry, convened a meeting in April between government officials and experts from Myanmar’s neighbouring countries. The forum invited representatives from Myanmar’s military government as well, Asia Nikkei reported. These discussions were initiated by Thailand, and then India hosted the follow-up round. The meetings provide an unofficial forum for stakeholders to exchange opinions in pursuit of a resolution."
“No Question Of Imposing Martial Law”: Pak Army After Violent Protests,https://idrw.org/no-question-of-imposing-martial-law-pak-army-after-violent-protests/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Pakistan’s Army has ruled out the possibility of imposing martial law in the country amidst the political turmoil and deteriorating law and order situation following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan, saying Army chief General Asim Munir and the entire military leadership believe in democracy. The remarks of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry came after an almost four-day political turmoil erupted due to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Khan’s arrest, in which Army’s installations, including the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, were also targeted. “There is no question of imposing martial law in the country,” he told Geo News, adding that Army chief General Asim Munir and the entire military leadership along with him believe in democracy. The Army remains Pakistan’s most powerful institution, having ruled it directly for close to half its 75-year history through three coups. Mr Chaudhry stressed that the Army’s unity is unwavering and will persist, serving as a pillar of stability and security for the nation. He also rejected social media rumours about resignations by top Army officers or anyone disobeying the military discipline. “No one in the Army has resigned and no one has disobeyed any order,” the military spokesman said on Friday. He also rejected the impression of division within the army in the wake of attacks on military facilities during protests following the arrest of Khan. “Despite the internal and external propaganda, the army is united and will remain,” he said. Major General Chaudhry further said that the army is united despite internal miscreants and external enemies. “The dream of dividing the Pakistan Army will remain a dream, the Army is united under the leadership of Army Chief General Asim Munir and will remain united.” He called upon the public and media to rely on verified information from official sources rather than giving credence to unfounded speculation. The Army has come under scanner after showing no response when the rioters ransacked the residence of Corps Commander Lahore after Khan was arrested on May 9. At least 10 people have been killed in the violence that erupted after Mr Khan’s dramatic arrest by the paramilitary Rangers from the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday. The unrest in the country has come to a halt for now as the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has provided blanket relief to Mr Khan and barred authorities from arresting the PTI chief till Monday morning. Mr Khan has been highly critical of the alleged role of the establishment, especially that of former Army chief General (retired) Qamar Javed Bajwa, in bringing down his government in April 2022. Before his retirement, Gen Bajwa said that the Pakistan Army will remain apolitical."

In an interview with Tasnim, Rear Admiral Ali Reza Tangsiri said the homegrown cruise missile “Qadr-474” can hit targets within a range of 2,000 kilometers. He noted that the Mahdavi- and Soleimani-class vessels have been equipped with the new long-range cruise missile. The commander stated that the advanced Soleimani warship, named after Lt. General Qassem Soleimani, has been armed with various types of missiles with ranges of 200, 300, 750 and 2,000 kilometers. He added that the IRGC Navy is going to employ a new coast-to-sea cruise missile, named after Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The Abu Mahdi missile and two other cruise missiles with 750-km and 2,000-km ranges are smart, can be guided and go after a new target before explosion, and can be launched even from regions deep in the land and behind the mountains to hit naval targets, he said. The commander also stated that the IRGC Navy will unveil four Soleimani-class vessels in the current Iranian year (ends on March 20, 2024). The vessels are named after martyrs Sayyad Shirazi, Hassan Baqeri, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Rais-Ali Delvari, he noted. The new military catamarans can travel at a speed of 45 knots and are furnished with 300-km and 750-km missiles, he added. In November 2020, the IRGC Navy unveiled plans to dispatch a flotilla of military vessels, including its first oceangoing warship, to the northern parts of the Indian Ocean. The IRGC’s oceangoing warship, 150 meters in length and weighing 4,000 tons, is a multipurpose vessel for long-range operations. It is furnished with missiles, air defense systems, and radars."
The time is ripe for the enhancement of Philippines-India strategic partnership,https://idrw.org/the-time-is-ripe-for-the-enhancement-of-philippines-india-strategic-partnership/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: The Manila Times THE driving force in a meaningful bilateral partnership is the convergence in perspectives on shared challenges and concerns, coupled with collaborative steps to counter it. Most soft attributes, such as shared commitment to democracy, the English language, a colonial past, to name a few, are essentially peripheral to a relationship, though they can certainly be enablers. India and the Philippines share many such commonalities. Yet, for decades, the relationship was at best polite and at worst, lacked depth and substance. This has dramatically changed with the shifts that took place within Manila’s domestic politics, and the alterations in the overarching regional security architecture brought by the expansionist aspirations of China and the intensifying power competition between Washington and Beijing in the Western Pacific region. Non-traditional partners With the advent of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s independent approach in Philippine foreign policy in 2016, Manila began to notably recalibrate the trajectory of its external relations, which paved the path for more robust strategic ties with non-traditional partners, such as India. This reformed foreign policy approach also coincided with the rising threats posed by an increasingly assertive China. While the Duterte administration sought to manage ties with China, Beijing’s narrowly defined regional ambitions continue to provoke the Philippines’ sovereignty and sovereign rights, particularly in the West Philippine Sea. Under Xi Jinping, China has demonstrated scant regard for fraternal relations and international law that could have a lasting and damaging impact on the Indo-Pacific, which would be inimical to global welfare. Both New Delhi and Manila have experienced combative, aggressive and arbitrary Chinese intrusions challenging their sovereignty and strategic interests. This lies at the heart of rapidly enhanced defense and security cooperation between India and the Philippines. The $375-million contract to supply shore-based anti-ship Brahmos supersonic missiles to the Philippines, the increase in regular high-level security meetings from both sides and the enhancement of naval exercises, are reflections of an entirely new way of engaging with each other to counter China’s expansionist agenda in the region. Under the current administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Manila realizes that the gravity of Beijing’s hegemonic ambitions is a matter of critical concern for the security of Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights. Reaching out to like-minded partners to strengthen its defense capabilities is the best way forward to deter and check Beijing. Marcos’ desire to deepen and broaden the Philippines’ security partnership with the United States, Japan and Australia, along with his visit to Washington from April 30 to May 4, serve as testaments to this acknowledgement. Convergences It is in this context that the potential remains high for the Philippines and India to further expand the scope of their evolving strategic partnership. Manila and New Delhi converge in several key areas of concern. Both countries seek to maintain the functionality of a democratic, equitable, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific. Both Indo-Pacific neighbors also share apprehensions regarding the possibility for the region to fall deeper into a catastrophic military confrontation that the global community can ill afford. Manila and New Delhi have also experienced China’s notorious attitude of ensuring political cooperation on one hand while congruently disrespecting its neighbor’s sovereignty on the other. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted President Xi Jinping in 2019 in the context of improving bilateral relations, Chinese troops were simultaneously crossing into Indian territory in an unabashed manner. Similarly, when Beijing pledged to manage bilateral ties with Manila during the meeting between Marcos and Xi in January, China once again engaged in provocative acts against Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights within Philippine waters just days after. The same thing occurred days after Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang’s Manila visit in April. These continued acts of deception have critically damaged trust vis-…-vis Beijing. The Philippines is conscious of Beijing’s obsession with the belief that the South China Sea (SCS) belongs to them. Marcos is a proactive and astute negotiator, and is acutely aware that Manila’s relations with Beijing had started to sour over a decade ago when China unilaterally claimed ownership of the entire SCS. India, similarly, is aware of Chinese claims on vast areas of its territories. Both New Delhi and Manila realize that only a collaborative approach would send an unequivocal message to Beijing. India also maintains close and robust strategic relations with the Philippines’ major defense partners. India continues to deepen and broaden its multifaceted security relations with Australia, the US and Japan bilaterally, and through several multilateral formats like the Quad, the Malabar and the Group of 20. The China threat is multidimensional and accords possibilities of enhanced cooperation between India and the Philippines, including in areas, such as cybersecurity and critical technologies, AI (artificial intelligence), robotics, satellite technology and space research, at a time when Beijing’s approach toward the West Philippine Sea relies heavily on asymmetric and non-military means of pursuing strategic objectives in a slow but sure fashion. The rise of the Philippines-India strategic partnership has just recently begun. Marcos and Modi must continue to strengthen the momentum of their evolving strategic partnership. The recent indication of willingness from both sides for India to deploy a defense attaché for its embassy in the Philippines is a step in the right direction. Moreover, India’s offer to enhance Manila’s cyber defense capabilities, and the completion of the first-ever maritime exercises between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) this month are other welcome developments. For the rest of the globe, struggling to recover from the pandemic, to cope with the negative spillovers of the war in Eastern Europe and to craft policies to address China’s increasing assertiveness, it will be a proactive and pragmatic step for the Philippines and India to further enhance and elevate the status of their improving partnership."

National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti have expressed worries about the “dangerous” situation in Pakistan, claiming it will affect India. Widespread protests broke out across Pakistan after the arrest of former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan by the paramilitary Rangers, prompting the deployment of the army as well as in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. “Whatever the situation is in Pakistan, it will not have any impact on the situation of Jammu and Kashmir. Whatever Pakistan has done in the last 30 years, it will fall into its own pit,” BJP general secretary organisation, Jammu and Kashmir, Ashok Koul, said. He also told reporters that the regional parties in the Union Territory are worried about Pakistan and had made statements that the worsening situation there would have an adverse impact on Jammu and Kashmir. “They are just harping on their old tunes. as far as India’s stand on the relationship with Pakistan is concerned, it is as it was that unless they stop supporting militant activities, India cannot think about having dialogue with them,” Koul said. On exit poll surveys for the Karnataka assembly elections giving an edge to the Congress over the BJP, Koul said winning or losing an election will not have any impact on his party. “Wherever elections are conducted, someone wins and someone loses. But, we believe that the BJP will come out as the number one party in Karnataka,” he said. In the past, like in the cases of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the BJP leader said, it has been seen that exit poll surveys showed something but it did not happen. “We believe in our work and determination, and we will come out as victorious. Winning or losing elections will not have any impact on the BJP,” he said. To a question about the delay in assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Koul said the situation in the Union Territory is comparatively better than it was before the abrogation of article 370 in 2019. He said that as far as assembly polls are concerned, the BJP is always ready for an election. “Those who are levelling allegations against the BJP, they are themselves losing ground, as you can see day in and day out people are changing parties,” Koul said. “I have heard that the J-K’s chief electoral officer is preparing for panchayat and local body elections… and maybe, assembly elections will be conducted along with these polls as the whole Election Commission machinery is busy with the preparations.

198 Indian Fishermen Released From Pakistan Jail,https://idrw.org/198-indian-fishermen-released-from-pakistan-jail/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Pakistan government on Friday night released 198 Indian fishermen at Attari-Wagah border who were caught for crossing the maritime international border. The fishermen who cross the maritime international border in the Arabian Sea are charged with violation of the Passport Act of the respective countries and are punished for a period of about six months. The Indian fishermen who were released by the Pakistan government said that they crossed the border while fishing as they were unaware of the border in the sea. “I was held in Pakistani jails for 5 years. 12 of us were caught while were fishing in two boats for crossing the border. There were no navigation buoys, beacons or marks on the water, and it was difficult for us to identify the border in the sea. I am very happy to be in my country now,” said Biku, one of the fishermen released by the Pakistan government. He added that there 5-6 Indian fishermen kept in Pakistan jails, and urged the government to help them. Indian and Pakistani fishermen often cross the international maritime border in the Arabian Sea. They are caught by the respective agencies of both countries. The issue occurs due to a dispute over Sir Creek between India and Pakistan. India wants to divide the estuary by following the Thalweg doctrine but Pakistan is not ready to do so which is leading it to a dispute. According to Thalweg doctrine, if a water body is passing between two countries then it must be divided in such a way that both countries should get an equal part of the water body. This division is impacting a major international Maritime border between Rann of Kutch and Sindh of Pakistan, which in a way is affecting both the countries’ exclusive economic zones. The Pakistani authorities arrest them when they cross the maritime border, as well as, also seize their boats. The fishermen demanded that those seized boats should be returned back to them. “We crossed over to Pakistan in the sea, there are no borders there. We were caught in 2018. We request you help those who are still left back in Pakistani jails. They took our boats and they do not return that,” said Ajgar, another fisherman. The solution to the above issue can be to provide communication and navigation kits to the fisherman by both countries so that they must be aware of the border lines. To minimize the issue, both countries should spread awareness, train the fisherman, and provide communication and navigation kits to the fisherman on a large scale so that they didn’t cross the borders. “I was fishing around the border when Pakistani boats came and took us. Many of us are still kept in Pakistani jails, please help them. We would also like to request the government to return our boats too,” said Vijay, a fisherman from Gujarat."

The second lowest bidder will have to supply the ATAGS at the same price as the lowest bidder to secure their share of the order. The ATAGS has successfully passed all user-assisted trials and is seen as a crucial asset, especially given the ongoing border standoff with China, where the People’s Liberation Army has deployed 155mm/52 calibre howitzers in significant numbers. The ATAGS is considered to be a game-changer in terms of artillery capabilities and is expected to significantly enhance India’s defence capabilities. The ATAGS has been in development for several years, with both Bharat Forge and Tata Defence and Aerospace investing heavily in its research and development. The ATAGS is a 155mm/52 calibre gun, with a range of over 40 km and a firing rate of 6-8 rounds per minute. It is equipped with state-of-the-art features such as automated ammunition handling, a digital fire control system, and a fully integrated communication system, making it one of the most advanced artillery guns in the world. With the successful completion of user-assisted trials and the approval from the MOD, Bharat Forge and Tata Defence and Aerospace are poised to play a crucial role in enhancing India’s defence capabilities. The production of the ATAGS is also expected to provide a boost to India’s manufacturing sector, with the potential for job creation and the development of new skills and technologies."
Modi-Biden meet likely to get Final nod for GE 414 engine ToT,https://idrw.org/modi-biden-meet-likely-to-get-final-nod-for-ge-414-engine-tot/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG On June 22, President Joe Biden will welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an official state visit to the United States. The visit is seen as an opportunity to strengthen Indo-US military ties and reduce India’s dependence on Russian military hardware. One key development that is expected to be discussed during the visit is the clearance of General Electric’s proposed plans to locally manufacture its F414 engines in India. Last week, it was reported that the US administration had made inquiries to General Electric regarding its plans to manufacture the F414 engine in India. The US government asked about the number of F414-powered fighter jets that India intends to procure and how it plans to enforce its intellectual property rights (IPR) in India, where General Electric has claimed complete transfer of technology (ToT) along with hot engine sections. The F414 engines will power the Tejas MkII fighter jets that the Indian Air Force (IAF) plans to procure. The Tejas MkII jets will replace the IAF’s ageing fleet of Jaguars, Mig-29s, and Mirage-2000s by 2035. The IAF has committed to initially procuring 108 units of the Tejas MkII, but sources claim that the orders may eventually surpass 170 units in the next decade as the IAF builds up its combat fleet. The move to locally manufacture the F414 engines in India is a significant step towards reducing India’s reliance on Russian military hardware, which has been a longstanding issue for the country. The proposed local manufacturing of the engines will not only help India build up its defence capabilities but also boost its domestic manufacturing sector."
Airbus scouts for A400 Logistics Partners in India,https://idrw.org/airbus-scouts-for-a400-logistics-partners-in-india/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Airbus Defence & Space officials recently visited India to explore potential partnerships for the supply chain of the Airbus A400M Atlas, a military cargo aircraft that is currently manufactured in Seville, Spain. The A400M Atlas is a strategic airlifter designed to perform a range of military and humanitarian operations, including the transportation of troops, equipment, and supplies. The aircraft has a maximum payload capacity of 37 tonnes and can carry a range of vehicles, including tanks and helicopters. idrw has learned that A400M is an offer to India on the line of a C-295M Transporter Aircraft deal that is to be locally manufactured by the Tata Group in a joint venture with Airbus. During their visit, officials from Airbus inspected Dynamatic Technologies Limited, an aero structure manufacturer based in Bangalore with clients such as Boeing and HAL. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of complex aerostructures for aircraft, including wing components, fuselage structures, and precision-machined assemblies. According to reports, Airbus has offered the A400M Atlas to the Indian Air Force (IAF) along the lines of the C-295M Transporter Aircraft, which is set to be locally manufactured in a joint venture between the Tata Group and Airbus. The IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) last year for 60-80 units of a medium transport aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Soviet-era An-32 Transporters. However, the A400M Atlas’s payload-carrying capabilities exceed the IAF’s requirements as outlined in their RFI. The A400M’s larger payload capacity and range make it a suitable option for long-range transportation and strategic airlift missions, while the C-295M is better suited for shorter-range missions."
Why IAF wanted EJ200 Engines for Tejas MkII,https://idrw.org/why-iaf-wanted-ej200-engines-for-tejas-mkii/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: API The Eurojet consortium, which proposed its EJ200 engine during a tender process in 2008, was initially the preferred choice for the Tejas Mk2 program. This was because, even at that time, the EJ200 engine had a lower power output than the F-414 engine (98 kilonewtons). However, the F-414 engine had a larger diameter, which meant that it could potentially require modifications to the fuselage of the aircraft. As a result, the Tejas Mk2 program was considering the EJ200 engine as a viable alternative due to its more compact size. The EJ200 engine, which incorporates a reheat system, was capable of producing only 90 kilonewtons of thrust. However, it was a lightweight engine that had a sufficient power-to-weight ratio when compared to the earlier version of the Tejas MkII aircraft, which was expected to have a maximum takeoff weight of just 15 tons. In addition, the EJ200 engine was offered with Transfer of Technology (ToT) to India, allowing for local production. Furthermore, a prospective EJ2x0 Stage 2 engine, with an upgraded core section, was also offered to power India’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) fighter jet, with a reheated output of around 120 kN. This would be a significant improvement in power output, making the EJ200 engine a desirable choice for India’s advanced fighter jet program. The EJ200 engine, while considered a strong contender for India’s Tejas Mk2 program, ultimately lost out to the F-414 engine due to pricing considerations. The Eurojet consortium was aware that their engine would not be the lowest bidder, given the higher price of European engines compared to American engines due to differences in production scale. However, the consortium was willing to match the price if India placed bulk orders."

Addressing the 6th Indian Ocean Conference here in the Bangladeshi capital, he also said a significant shared concern through the Indian Ocean is that of unsustainable debt generated by unviable projects. “When nations disregard the legal obligations or violate long-standing agreements. As we have seen, the damage to trust and confidence is immense,” he said, apparently referring to China’s violation of border pacts with India. India has been slamming China’s deployment of a massive number of troops and its aggressive behaviour along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh in violation of pacts on border management. India has firmly told China that its violation of the border pacts has eroded the entire basis of bilateral ties and that all issues relating to the frontier must be resolved by the existing agreements. “There are lessons from the last two decades that we ignore at our peril. If we encourage opaque lending practices, exorbitant ventures and price points that are unrelated to the market, these are bound to bite us back sooner rather than later,” he said.

India plans deeper connectivity with Middle East to counter China’s footprint in Gulf,https://idrw.org/india-plans-deeper-connectivity-with-middle-east-to-counter-chinas-footprint-in-gulf/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: ANI To counter China’s footprint in Gulf, India is planning an ambitious connectivity project that aims to link New Delhi to the Middle East, reported Foreign Policy. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval held a meeting with his US and UAE counterparts, which was also attended by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The leaders discussed a joint infrastructure project that would connect the Middle Eastern countries via rail. The ambitious connectivity project aims to link the Middle East to India through roads, rails, and seaports. The idea emerged during meetings of the I2U2 group–which also includes Israel–over the last year, Axios reported. The I2U2 group–a relatively new vehicle for US-India cooperation in the Middle East–was not envisioned as a China-focused entity, given the close commercial cooperation that both the UAE and Israel enjoy with China, reported Foreign Policy. Saudi Arabia hasn’t formalized relations with Israel, which means the latter isn’t a formal part of the project, but its membership in I2U2 suggests it will have a role. The connectivity project shows just how much India benefits from the Abraham Accords, the Trump-era agreement that normalized relations between Israel and several of its Arab neighbours. The deal allowed for the establishment of the I2U2 group, and discussions there gave rise to the new initiative, reported Foreign Policy. The proposed initiative signals that India and the United States are ready to take their joint efforts to counter China beyond the Indo-Pacific region and into the Middle East. It’s clear the Biden administration views the connectivity project as a way to balance Chinese power in the region. “Nobody said it out loud, but it was about China from day one,” a former senior Israeli official told Axios. The connectivity project aims to leverage India’s capacity as an infrastructure provider. Its track record includes the construction of the world’s largest rail system in Asia and contributions to cross-border electricity-sharing arrangements. Through the new initiative, Indian officials hope to develop a deeper infrastructure footprint in the Middle East to counter China’s BRI. According to one assessment, in a best-case scenario, India could eventually benefit from land and sea trade routes stretching from Israel and the UAE all the way to Greece’s Piraeus port and onward into Europe. India wants to participate in a new multilateral effort to push back against China’s growing Middle East footprint–driven by Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments and by a recent strategic agreement with Iran. Notably, Beijing also recently mediated a reconciliation deal between Tehran and Riyadh, reported Foreign Policy. The Middle East is an increasingly significant space for India, given its trade interests there and the several million Indians who work in the region and send remittances back home. Moreover, recently Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen visited New Delhi. Although he departed early because of a crisis with Gaza, he likely planned to meet with Indian interlocutors about the connectivity project. In a statement released before the visit, Cohen said India can play a key role in strengthening regional stability in the Middle East, reported Foreign Policy. India now has opportunities to scale up influence, trade, and diplomacy beyond the Indo-Pacific region–all in a year while holding the G-20 presidency, enjoying rapid economic growth, and overtaking China as the world’s most populous country."
Committed To Well Being Of Indian Ocean Nations: S Jaishankar In Dhaka,https://idrw.org/committed-to-well-being-of-indian-ocean-nations-s-jaishankar-in-dhaka/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: ANI External Affairs Minister S Jaishanakar, on Friday, reiterated India’s commitment to the well-being of Indian Ocean countries. Addressing the 6th Indian Ocean Conference in Dhaka, MR Jaishankar said, “Reiterating India’s commitment to the well-being and progress of all nations of the Indian Ocean. We have dedicated bodies like the Indian Ocean Rim Association or the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, with their specific mandates.” He also stated that India had expanded on that belief through the Neighbourhood First policy, the SAGAR outlook and our approach to the extended neighbourhood. India also believed that a seamless transition into an Indo-Pacific is to the collective advantage. “This is a gathering of like-minded to have an open and fruitful discussion on various dimensions of our cooperation. I wish the deliberation all success,” Mr Jaishankar added. At the event, Mr Jaishankar praised Bangladesh for releasing its Indo-Pacific outlook and joining a number of countries in articulating its thinking on the subject. Indo-Pacific is a reality and statement of contemporary globalisation, he added. EAM also stated UNCLOS should be respected and termed Bangladesh a “successful developing economy.” Mr Jaishankar, at the event, without naming any nation said that when the country disregards their legal obligations or violates long-standing agreements, the damage done to “trust and confidence is immense”. Mr Jaishankar also spoke about “unsustainable debt”. He said, “A significant shared concern through the Indian Ocean is that of unsustainable debt generated by unviable projects. There are lessons from the last two decades that we ignore at our peril. If we encourage opaque lending practices, exorbitant ventures and price points that are unrelated to the market, these are bound to bite us back, sooner rather than later.” “Especially so when sovereign guarantees have been proffered, not always with due diligence. Many of us in the region are today confronting the consequences of our past choices. This is a time to reflect and reform, not one to repeat and reiterate,” EAM added. He also stated that connectivity is a particularly crucial issue for all of the countries and this is because the era of imperialism disrupted the natural linkages of the continent and created regional silos to serve its own ends. “In many cases, the hinterland was disadvantaged to the benefit of the coastal areas. Building back in the post-colonial era is a long, painful and arduous task. It is still very much a work in progress. How to restore, indeed enhance flows between distinct regions is today of the utmost priority. For a nation like India, this means a land connection to South East Asia. And a multi-modal one to the Gulf and beyond. Central Asia offers its own distinct challenges due to obstacles in between,” Mr Jaishankar said. “Collectively, the more we work on facilitating smooth and effective connectivity, the better off we all are. And obviously, we need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while doing so. Let me, therefore, underline that from India’s perspective, efficient and effective connectivity to ASEAN in particular will be a game-changer. We accord this the utmost priority,” he added."
Pak press councillor in Washington fuels anti-India narrative in US,https://idrw.org/pak-press-councillor-in-washington-fuels-anti-india-narrative-in-us/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Spewing venom against India, the Press Counsellor of the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, Sarfraz Hussain called on the international community to not remain silent as India is to host the G20 tourism summit in Srinagar. The Pakistani diplomat’s hate comments came as India is to host several G20 events in Jammu and Kashmir. Last month, India released a full calendar of events leading up to the summit, which included G20 and Youth 20 meetings in Srinagar and in Leh, in the region of Ladakh, in April and May. Pakistan has “vehemently condemned” India’s move, saying such a move was “self-serving” on New Delhi’s part. Taking to his Twitter handle, the Pakistani councillor posted an opinion by The Washington Post Columnist Rana Ayubb. It said it warns of a much darker narrative to define “Modi’s India”, calling the country’s democracy an ‘unhealthy’ one. Writing in her opinion for the Washington Post against India, and PM Modi, Ayyub said, “But a much darker narrative is starting to define Modi’s India. The government has been systematically oppressing, marginalizing and inciting hatred toward its 220-million Muslim minority. This campaign has been slowly gathering momentum over the years and has reached new levels of intensity today. India is not a healthy democracy.” Taking sides with the Washington Post’s columnist, the Pakistani diplomat has called for the support of the global community, fueling the hatred against India, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi even more. “Calling upon Int. community not to remain silent, @RanaAyyub warns that “a much darker narrative is starting to define Modi’s India.” “India is not a healthy democracy.” Modi is enflaming hatred of Muslims in India, as the world looks the other way,” the Press Counsellor Embassy of Pakistan in Washington tweeted. This year, India will host the G20 summit under its presidency, and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration. Since becoming India’s dominant political force in 2014, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made its mark on the nation. Under PM Modi’s leadership, India has become a more significant actor on the global stage, and this fact cannot be denied. However, regarding issues of cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, relations between the two nations have been tense for a long time, notwithstanding Islamabad’s demands for the reinstatement of Article 370 for the formerly Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. In a recent affair, Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari participated in SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting that took place in Goa, India, where he remarked on not getting caught up in weaponising terrorism for diplomatic point scoring. Lambasting Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari for his “weaponising terrorism” remarks, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, later said that it means “they think terrorism is legitimate” and that India is politically, diplomatically exposing Pakistan before the world as it is a victim of cross-border terrorism. “Okay, now what are we doing? We are countering ourselves. Countering terrorism? We are defending ourselves. We are calling it out. We are exposing it… So, to me, we are not scoring diplomatic points. We are politically, diplomatically, exposing Pakistan before the world. And as a victim of terrorism, I’m completely entitled to do so,” Jaishankar said. He said India has every right to defend itself from cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar said Pakistan is a “spokesperson of the terrorism industry”. India has consistently raised the issue of Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism and terrorist infiltration. It has been said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have borne the brunt of this terrorism campaign for decades and continue to do so. In the summer of 2019, the Indian government abrogated Article 370, which granted Jammu and Kashmir special autonomous status. With the removal of the special autonomous status, it became easier for businesses to operate in the region, as they were no longer subject to some of the regulations that had previously hindered their growth. The prospect of hosting a G20 summit in Jammu and Kashmir presents unparalleled opportunities for the region, instilling hope for renewed stability and prosperity. Hosting the G20 summit will position Jammu and Kashmir at the heart of diplomatic relations and foster cooperation. Delegates will gain first-hand knowledge of the region, providing valuable insights into the challenges and growth potential. The summit will provide a platform for Jammu and Kashmir to showcase its resources and potential, establishing connections that can bolster sustainable development."

Jaishankar said on Friday that when nations disregard their legal obligations or violate longstanding agreements, the damage to trust and confidence is immense. Addressing the 6th Indian Ocean Conference here in the Bangladeshi capital, he also said a significant shared concern through the Indian Ocean is that of unsustainable debt generated by unviable projects. “The importance of adhering to the law, observing norms and respecting rules is a natural convergence point,” he said, adding that it is not possible to build a stable international order without these prerequisites. “This is especially so in a continent that has seen so much growth and so much change. When nations disregard legal obligations or violate long-standing agreements. As we have seen, the damage to trust and confidence is immense,” he said, apparently referring to China’s violation of border pacts with India. “It is therefore essential that all of us take the long view of our cooperation, rather than a tactical one of our interests,” he said.

Many of us in the region are today confronting the consequences of our past choices,” he said. China’s unproductive projects in Sri Lanka, including the Hambantota port, which Beijing took over on a 99-year lease as a debt swap, have come under sharp criticism. China, which accounts for 10 per cent of Sri Lanka’s debt, is reported to have resisted offering a debt cut. He said this was a time to reflect and reform, not to repeat and reiterate. He said Indo-Pacific is a reality and becoming more so with each passing day. “It is a statement of our contemporary globalisation and underlining that we are getting past the framework of 1945. There are obviously nations that have a vested interest in perpetuating the past. As indeed they have in larger international relations, including the structure of the United Nations,” he said. He said because the world is understandably seized by the larger domain of the Indo-Pacific, the countries should not underplay the issues and challenges of one of its core constituents the nations of the Indian Ocean. While highlighting the importance of smooth and effective connectivity, Jaishankar said countries need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity. India has been opposing the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, giving China access to the Arabian Sea through the Gwadar port in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Jaishankar said there are some global challenges that also merit regional considerations, especially climate action and counter-terrorism. “The universality of these concerns is by now well recognised. It is essential that our conversations aim to encourage common positions. We must also be conscious of the threats to the social fabric posed by extremism and fundamentalism taking advantage of democratic openness. The costs of not doing so are also starkly apparent to all of us today,” he said. Jaishankar said India is committed to the well-being and progress of all nations of the Indian Ocean. “We believe that a seamless transition into an Indo-Pacific is to our collective advantage,” he said. The US, India and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China’s rising military manoeuvring in the resource-rich region. China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea. China also has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea.

"India, UAE connection deeply rooted in shared cultural heritage, maritime trade",https://idrw.org/india-uae-connection-deeply-rooted-in-shared-cultural-heritage-maritime-trade/,"May 13, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The ties between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are firmly anchored in their common cultural heritage and marine trade for a long time. These linkages have radically altered the geopolitics of the area and have proven a testament to the resilience of international collaboration and diplomacy. In the last 50 years, India has also learned that its relationship with the UAE goes beyond just trade and business. There are a number of other factors that naturally bind the two nations together, such as their mutual respect for the principles of national sovereignty, the social security of Indian expatriates in the Arab Gulf region, and their relationship. As a result of a convergence of interests in regional security, energy cooperation, and the digital economy, which reflects the common objectives and visions of both countries, the alliance has recently shown visions of a strategic pivot, according to Dr Maheep, an Expert of India’s Foreign Affairs with Specialisation in Arab Gulf States and Islam. India, which is currently in charge of the G20, is formally adhering to tradition by inviting non-member nations and international groups to the G20 Summit. Egypt, Mauritius, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Spain, Singapore, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bangladesh are among the nations that have been invited this year. UAE is currently India’s second-largest export market and third-largest trading partner. In the upcoming years, it is anticipated that the amount of trade between them will increase from USD60 billion in 2019-2020 to USD100 billion. In December last year, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that more Indian citizens live in the UAE than in any other country abroad. In February 2022, India and the UAE previously agreed to a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). The two nations have long been acquainted and actively involved with one another, but since 2016, there has been a noticeable rise in the quality of their relations, which has reached an unparalleled height with CEPA. In 2015, Narendra Modi made a visit to the United Arab Emirates, the first by the Indian Prime Minister in more than 40 years. Since the visit, the ties between India and the UAE have grown stronger. Author Maheep, in his article, mentions how in recent times, India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have engaged in discussions on a range of themes of both strategic and cultural significance. This includes an agreement to create a USD 75 billion infrastructure development fund, discussions to fill India’s strategic oil reserves at Mangalore with UAE assistance, the addition of Hindi as the third official language in the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD), the building of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi, the trend of reverse migration, the flash floods in Kerala, the cooperation following the Pulwama tragedy, and the exodus of Palestinians from Israel. With the number of preferential certificates of origin issued under the India-UAE CEPA rising from 415 in May 2022 to 8440 in March 2023, usage of the agreement has been continuously growing. While India has achieved quick duty elimination on more than 80 per cent of its tariff lines, which correspond to 90 per cent of India’s exports in value terms, the UAE abolished taxes on 97.4 per cent of its tariff lines, which amount to 99 per cent of imports from India. Both countries have made more significant and deeper commitments in the area of services across all industries and supply channels, author Maheep writes. Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi, the UAE’s Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, claims that the CEPA represents a turning point in bilateral relations and is a model of international collaboration in the post-COVID-19 era. The Lulu Group, The Indian People’s Forum (IPF), The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the Annual Investment Meeting, Texmas, and The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) are just a few of the well-known groups supporting the event, the author added. Along with Israel and the United States, India and the UAE are members of the I2U2 mini-lateral group, which intends to enhance collaborative investments in a variety of fields, including water, food security, transportation, energy, health, and space, in addition to the CEPA. On February 21-22, 2023, the most recent high-level conference of the India, Israel, US, and UAE grouping (I2U2) was convened in Abu Dhabi to address investment prospects and “pressing issues including food insecurity and the energy crisis.” The premiers of the four nations noted in a joint statement issued in July 2022 that they intended to enlist the help of the private sector to modernise infrastructure, advance low-carbon development pathways for industries, advance physical connectivity between nations in the Middle East, improve public health and access to vaccines, and promote the development of critical emerging and green technologies while ensuring near- and long-term financial viability. Although it is still in the early stages, there are already discussions on potential defence cooperation between the two nations. Furthermore, UAE has committed to investing USD2 billion to build integrated food parks across India. The UAE is home to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and will host COP28 in 2023. Modern climate-smart technologies will be installed in the latter, allowing it to use renewable energy sources, lessen food waste and spoilage, and conserve fresh water. India is anticipated to make suitable land available for the project and to organise the integration of farmers into the food parks.

Sinha said the locals face some difficulties wherever infrastructure projects are taken up but the traders cooperated with the authorities. “I express gratitude to the traders who cooperated. I am sure it will increase the business here,” he said. This is just a start and in the days to come, the smart city project will develop many such markets at Residency Road, Lal Chowk and the old city area, the Lt Governor said. “The endeavour to make Srinagar look like Delhi or Chandigarh or other big cities is on. The people who have come here would have felt that they were in Delhi or Mumbai and not in Srinagar. You will get to see many more markets like this in the coming days,” Sinha added. Other than the Polo View market, the LG also inaugurated two other Srinagar Smart City Projects and 25 Urban Local Bodies (ULB) projects. The two smart city projects include Abi Guzar Shiv temple, which has been renovated and dedicated to the people and smart advanced traffic management vehicles that have been included in the fleet for Srinagar smart city. Of the Urban Local Bodies (ULB) projects dedicated to the public, 16 are development projects in 11 ULBs and nine solid waste management facilities in 10 ULBs. The LG said these projects will significantly boost urban infrastructure and give an impetus to ease of living. “The holistic approach in developing urban infrastructure is focused on Individual’s well-being, new avenues and opportunities for the people for more diversified incomes, improved service delivery, mobility, cleanliness and to achieve the objectives of sustainable urban development,” Sinha said. Bicycle-sharing facilities for different locations in the city were also inaugurated on the occasion by the Lt Governor."

This decision comes after the grounding of the ALH-Dhruv fleet due to issues with its control rods. The LCH program borrows several parts from the ALH-Dhruv program, leading to the temporary grounding of LCH as well. Last year, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Army placed an order for 15 Light Combat Helicopters (LCH), with 10 allocated to the IAF and five to the Army. However, according to report in “The Print”, the IAF has only received five of its 10 orders, and they are undergoing the same checks and balances as the ALH after Dhruv’s crashes last month. “The Print” Sources have also mentioned that the LCH is based on the ALH design and is essentially a derivative of it. As a result, it may encounter similar technical problems, so reason behind its grounding."

Khalistan event cancelled by city council in Australia: Report,https://idrw.org/khalistan-event-cancelled-by-city-council-in-australia-report/,"May 12, 2023","SOURCE: IANS A city council in Australia has cancelled a Khalistan propaganda referendum event in Sydney following numerous complaints about threats posed by the event, a media report said on Friday. Acting on security agencies’ advice, the Blacktown City Council cancelled the event scheduled to be organised at Blacktown Leisure Centre Stanhope by the pro-Khalistan Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), The Australia Today reported. “Council has, this morning, cancelled this booking as it is in conflict with adopted Council policy and due to risks to Council staff, Council assets and members of the public which cannot be practicably mitigated,” a Blacktown City Council spokesperson told the media outlet. “Council’s decision is in no way an endorsement of, or criticism of, any political position relating to the internal affairs of India or Pakistan and must not be represented as support for any particular political position,” he added. The development comes just days ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the country on May 23. Among the many complainants, Arvind Gaur, a resident, had written a letter to Mayor of the Blacktown City Council, Tony Bleasdale, informing him about terrorists being praised via posters and banners by the SFJ event. Gaur told The Australia Today that he has received a reply from the council CEO Kerry Robinson explaining that the unauthorised banners and posters are being removed by Council officials and they have sought advice from the NSW Police. “We are removing the banners and posters around the city placed on public property as these have been erected without our approval,” Robbinson said.

"Khalistan movement, a compound threat to India, West, and Sikhism: Report",https://idrw.org/khalistan-movement-a-compound-threat-to-india-west-and-sikhism-report/,"May 12, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The International Forum For Rights and Security (IFFRAS), in its comprehensive report on the Khalistan movement, has provided a valuable resource for understanding the complexities and global implications of this issue. More than just a challenge to Indian sovereignty, this movement also presents a significant threat to Western countries and ironically, to the very principles of Sikhism it purports to uphold, Khalsa Vox reported. The Khalistan movement, a propaganda-driven campaign demanding a separate state for Sikhs, has long been a source of discord in India, the report stated. While the movement has largely been eliminated within India’s borders, it continues to thrive among some sections of the Indian diaspora, causing serious concerns. Its implications, however, extend far beyond India’s sovereignty, posing a significant threat to Western countries and even the very ethos of Sikhism, Khalsa Vox reported. The report talks about certain organizations as the key propagators of Khalistan ideology. These entities are not just ideological extremists, but they engage in real-world disruptions, from the vandalism of public property to strategic attacks on Indian diplomatic missions, such as those seen in Melbourne, London, and San Francisco. Their actions don’t merely pose a threat to India’s territorial integrity but they also exploit the liberal laws of their host countries, using the power of social media to spread their divisive narrative far and wide. These entities have been proscribed by the Indian government as terrorist organizations, Khalsa Vox reported. As per the report, the Khalistan movement bears an unsettling resemblance to the Muslim Brotherhood, in its demand for a state based on a narrowly defined religious doctrine and its disregard for democratic principles. Both celebrate illiberalism, advocating violence and displaying intolerance towards other religions, Khalsa Vox reported. This subversive campaign is fueled by funds from Pakistani intelligence and Khalistani sympathizers in the West. Western governments need to recognize the gravity of this threat and take decisive action against this hateful agenda propagated through social media and obscure internet platforms. It’s time for the West to secure the rights of the Indian diaspora, acting decisively to quell the communal tensions being instigated by foreign entities. India, undoubtedly, has a significant role to play in educating Western nations about the complexities of South Asian geopolitics. However, the question remains if the West is willing to listen and understand. The report states that pro-Khalistan outfits in the West have notorious connections with terrorists and banned organizations/entities. These individuals and groups are allegedly involved in training young Sikh youths in Canada with automatic and sniper rifles, pointing to a serious, and urgent, security concern. The Western governments’ lack of urgency in addressing the Khalistan threat is worrying. Political sensitivity towards the Sikh minority, particularly in regions like British Columbia, Ontario, and Alberta, seems to hinder a full-scale crackdown. It’s high time that this issue is confronted, not sidestepped, Khalsa Vox reported. The era of foreign entities stirring up communal tensions in India is regrettably resurfacing in Western countries. The said report highlights incidents like those in Australia, where armed Sikhs attack the Indian diaspora, which is deeply concerning. The collaboration of Pakistan’s Khalistani project runners with organized crime syndicates in the West further compounds this threat. Perhaps the most tragic irony of this entire situation is that the Khalistani propaganda hurts Sikh sentiments and contradicts the principles of Sikhism, a religion that promotes peace, equality, and universal brotherhood. The manipulation of the faith for political gains is a grave injustice to millions of Sikhs worldwide. The IFFRAS report has provided a much-needed lens to examine the multifaceted threat that the Khalistani propaganda presents, Khalsa Vox reported. It’s clear that this issue extends beyond the boundaries of India, affecting Western nations and tarnishing the tenets of Sikhism. The report underscores the urgency for unified international action, grounded in an understanding of South Asian geopolitics and the principles of peaceful co-existence that Sikhism truly upholds. These findings must be used as a catalyst for change, to counter extremist narratives, and to promote a global community that respects territorial sovereignty, religious tolerance, and the true essence of every faith, Khalsa Vox reported further."

Passing through the lanes and bylanes of the interior city, Additional Director General of Police (Kashmir Range) Vijay Kumar reached a checkpost at Panthachowk, an area always bustling with traffic as it forms part of the National Highway connecting the Valley with the rest of the country. A 1997-batch IPS officer, Kumar took out time to stand with his jawans who have been tirelessly maintaining tight vigil along the crucial highway, a possible route for terrorists to enter the city. Kumar, who was accompanied by Senior Superintendent of Police Rakesh Balwal, found out about the difficulties of the personnel besides guiding them in performing their job in pressing circumstances. “This is a high-pressure job but, in the end, we have to be 100 per cent alert. Any failure can prove costly,” Kumar told the police personnel on duty. Talking to PTI Video, Kumar said the police force is completely geared up to meet any challenge. “Generally, we have a naka (checkpost) for 365 days but whenever an important event happens, every one of us is on the roads to ensure that people sleep peacefully. “The number of checkposts has definitely increased and many of my senior officers are moving around the city in the last 15 days. Today, I have come out myself to boost their morale and stand next to my jawans on the road,” Kumar said. He said patrolling is part of maintaining night domination of the areas and helps in countering any threat of a terrorist sneaking into the city from South Kashmir. He accepted that there is a threat from terror groups in view of the forthcoming G20 meeting. “Obviously, the threat is there but what are we here for? Let us not forget the motto of J-K Police that says ‘A saga of sacrifice and courage’. Nothing untoward will happen,” Kumar said. Kashmir will host the third G20 tourism working group meeting from May 22 to 24. The first working group meeting on tourism was held at the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat in February and the second one in West Bengal’s Siliguri in April. This is the first international meeting being held in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union Territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Kumar also went into the interiors of the Nowgam area in Srinagar where the threat, mainly from the banned Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group, has been higher. He met the police and CRPF personnel posted there and took stock of the situation. During his visit to the area, Kumar pointed to an under-construction building and directed the officers to post a sniper there to ensure that the eventuality of a suicide terror attack is averted. The Valley’s top police officer also pointed out that women cops were also present in the likelihood that female passengers need to be searched. “We are religiously following all the Standard Operating Procedures and are hopeful that the event will pass off peacefully,” Kumar said. He also said some preventive arrests of overground workers and suspects were made as a precautionary measure."

Hosted by Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command Admiral John Christopher Aquilino at Sunnylands in California, the Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue is also being attended by Japan’s Chief of Joint Staff General Yoshida Yoshihide and the Chief of the Australian Defence Force General Angus Campbell. “General Anil Chauhan CDS put forth India’s views in the 1st session ‘Deterrence Through Effective Partnerships’,” said Headquarters of Integrated Defence Staff. The gathering of top military commanders comes just before next week’s third Quad Leaders’ Summit hosted by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Sydney which will also witness the presence of PM Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden and Japanese PM Fumio Kishida. The Quad partners will be meeting immediately after the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Hiroshima (May 19-21). Kishida has already extended an invitation to PM Modi for the summit where the leaders are expected to discuss common interests, including China’s rapidly increasing imprint in the Indo-Pacific region. The extensive interactions will continue as, a few months later in September, India will host the leaders again for the G20 Leaders’ Summit. The Sunnylands dialogue began just as the US Air Force wrapped up a bilateral fighter training exercise ‘Cope Thunder’ with the Philippine Air Force – the first since 1990 – at Clark Air Base on Luzon Island to strengthen the defence of the region with its allies and like-minded forces. Interestingly, the Philippines Secretary for Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo met Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi in Tokyo on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the East and South China Seas. Last week, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told the Senate Appropriations Defence Subcommittee that the international rules-based system that has kept great power peace since the end of World War II is under increasing stress. Milley labelled China as the long-term geostrategic security challenge for the United States, emphasising that Beijing has publicly stated that it intends to be the regional hegemon in Asia within the next 10 years and to exceed the United States’ overall military capability by the mid-century. “Chinese actions are moving it on a path toward potential confrontation with its neighbours and the United States. But, again, war with China is neither inevitable nor imminent,” said Milley. As reported by IndiaNarrative.com, Washington has maintained that India remains a key pillar in US strategy in the Indo-Pacific region as it builds alliances and partnerships to the ongoing implementation of the US National Defence Strategy. “The deputy secretary thanked NSA Doval for India’s leadership in the region and discussed avenues to deepen coordination between the US and Indian militaries to address the region’s increasingly contested strategic environment,” Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said after February’s meeting between National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and the US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks in the US capital. Admiral Aquilino, who visited India a month later, reaffirmed the India-US strategic partnership, noting that military cooperation between the two nations – who have shown a shared commitment to a resilient, rules-based international order that promotes a free and open Indo-Pacific for all – is at an all-time high."

A reservation policy for Agniveers is also on the anvil in the Railway Protection Force (RPF), they said. The reservation provided by the Railways — 10 per cent in Level 1 and five per cent in Level 2 and above non-gazetted posts — will be in the nature of horizontal reservation as in the case of Person with Benchmark Disability (PwBD), ex-servicemen and Course Completed Act Apprentices (CCAAs). The Agniveers will also be given exemption from physical efficiency tests and age relaxations — five years for the first batch of Agniveers and three for the subsequent batches — over and above the existing age limit prescribed for different communities for Level-1, Level-2 and above posts. The sources said the Railway Board has issued letters to all General Managers asking them to provide these relaxation/facilities in recruitment by Railway Recruiting Agencies (Railway Recruitment Boards/Railway Recruitment Cells) from open market in Pay Level-1 and Pay Level-2 and above non-gazetted posts to those Agniveers who successfully complete four years in the forces. Under the Agnipath recruitment scheme, which was unveiled by the Centre last year, after the completion of four years, 25 per cent of the recruits will be absorbed in the forces. Horizontal reservation refers to equal opportunity provided to some categories of beneficiaries such as women, veterans, transgenders, and people with disabilities, cutting through the vertical categories. Many central ministries, state governments and industry bodies are offering suitable career alternatives to former Agniveers through similar job reservation schemes. The Agniveers who have successfully completed the service period can apply with documentary proof against Centralised Employment Notifications issued by Railway Recruiting Agencies for recruitment of staff from open market against the non-gazetted pay grades. The Board’s letter to the GMs said there will be no carry forward of the unfilled vacancies i.e. in case of shortfall, the vacant slots shall be filled from others in the combined merit list. It also said that Agniveers who have completed their full tenure of four years shall be charged ? 250 only for applying for open market recruitment conducted by Railway recruiting agencies with a provision for refunding the same to those who actually appear in the written exam. Level 1 posts examination is conducted for the selection of assistants in various branches of the Railways. The level 2 and above posts include junior clerk-cum-typist, accounts clerk-cum-typist, station managers, junior engineers among other categories."

This comes after the bloc’s chief diplomat earlier said that the EU should crack down on India reselling Russian oil as refined fuels including diesel into Europe as Western nations move to tighten sanctions on Moscow’s energy sector. “India buys Russian oil, it’s normal… ” said EU’s Foreign policy chief Borrell but wants the bloc to act on refined products coming from India-made Russian crude in an interview with Financial Times. While Borrell met with Mr Jaishankar at the trade technology talks in Brussels, he was not present at the press conference that followed. In his place, EU Executive Vice President on Competition, Margrethe Vestager said that there was “no doubt about the legal basis of the sanctions”, and that the EU and India would have the discussion as “friends… with an extended hand and of course, not a pointed finger.” Along with Mr Jaishankar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, and Union Minister of State for Entrepreneurship, Skill Development, Electronics and Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar were also in the meeting. Jaishankar on Monday arrived in Brussels for the last leg of his three-nation visit covering Bangladesh, Sweden and Belgium. Earlier also Mr Jaishankar had defended India’s imports from Russia while indirectly criticising the West for pressurising New Delhi to minimise its trade with Russia in view of its military action in Ukraine. He wondered how Europe could make choices to prioritise its own energy needs and at the same time ask India to do something else. “Our trade with Russia is at a very small level- USD 12-13 billion, in comparison to European countries. We’ve also given the Russians a set of products… I don’t think people should read more into it other than the legitimate expectations of any trading country to increase its trade,” the EAM said earlier in December while addressing a joint press conference with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock. “I would urge you to look at these figures. There is a website called ‘Russia Fossil Fuel Tracker’ that would give you country-by-country data of who is really importing what and I suspect that might be very very helpful,” he added."

A defence spokesperson said that the crude bomb was locally fabricated and the soldier who was trying to diffuse it did not suffer major injuries. A day before, a policeman was killed and four others injured when suspected militants opened fire at them near Tera Khongfangbi also in Bishnupur district. Since then the police and army personnel had launched a combing operation to flush out the militants from the area, officials said. Violent clashes had broken out in the northeastern state after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts on May 3 to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. The clashes were preceded by tension over the eviction of Kuki villagers from reserve forest land, which had led to a series of smaller agitations and tension between the Meiteis and Kukis. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals — Nagas and Kukis — constitute another 40 per cent of the population and reside in the hill districts. A total of 128 columns of the Indian Army and Assam Rifles or nearly 10,000 soldiers have been deployed in the affected areas."

Russia ‘destroys US-built Patriot air defense system’ in Kiev,https://idrw.org/russia-destroys-us-built-patriot-air-defense-system-in-kiev/,"May 17, 2023","SOURCE : PRESS TV Russia says it has destroyed a US-built Patriot air defense system in an overnight barrage of missile and drone strikes on Ukraine’s capital, Kiev. The Russian military said on Tuesday it destroyed the US air defense system using a hypersonic Kinzhal missile. The missile is capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads up to 2,000 kilometers. Last year, for the first time Russia used the weapon in warfare in Ukraine. In addition, the Russian defense ministry said it launched several strikes from land, sea, and air on Kiev in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It had carried out “high-precision” attacks on Ukrainian units, ammunition, and storage sites, the ministry said. “Targets achieved.” The Zvezda military news outlet quoted the Russian ministry as saying the attacks had been aimed at Ukrainian fighting units and ammunition storage sites. Kiev also confirmed the attacks. “It was exceptional in its density – the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time,” Serhiy Popko, head of Kiev’s city military administration, said on Telegram. In the meantime, Ukraine claimed it shot down 18 Russian missiles, including an entire volley of six Kinzhals. Earlier this month, Kiev claimed its forces had shot down a single Kinzhal missile over the capital for the first time using a newly deployed US Patriot air defense system. Russia launched its full-scale military campaign on Ukraine in February last year. It has so far managed to annex around a sixth of its neighbor’s territory. It says the invasion was necessary to counter a threat to its security posed by Kiev’s close ties to the West. Since the onset of the war, the West has supplied Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons, including rocket systems, drones, armored vehicles, tanks, and communication systems despite Russia’s repeated warnings that the Western military assistance will only prolong the conflict."

A bench headed by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma was also informed that similar changes are under consideration for other paramilitary organisations. The central government sought eight weeks’ time for completing the process of amending the recruitment rules. The statement was made by the central government counsel on a petition alleging “institutional discrimination” against women in recruitment of constables and drivers in the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). “Learned CGSC (central government standing counsel) has informed this court that a proposal has already been forwarded by CISF on 23.03.2023 for amending the Recruitment Rules in order to make provision for recruitment of women/ females for the post of Constable/ Driver and Constable/Driver-cum-Pump Operator (Driver for Fire Services) in CISF at par with males,” recorded the bench, which also comprised Justice Subramonium Prasad, in its order dated May 9. “It is also informed by him that similar amendments are being made in respect of Recruitment Rules governing the other Para-Military Organisations,” it noted. The court took the Centre’s stand on record and listed the matter for further consideration on August 29. Petitioner Kush Kalra had approached the high court in 2018 after finding that an advertisement issued by CISF invited applications from only male candidates for the posts of constable/driver and constable/driver-cum-pump operator for fire services” in the force. The plea, filed through advocate Charu Wali Khanna, has said the human rights of women were inalienable and an integral and indivisible part of human rights and there was no rationale for not recruiting women to the posts. “The respondents (Centre and CISF) are practising institutional discrimination, without any rationale basis depriving females the right to serve in the aforementioned posts. The state cannot enact any law which is inconsistent with/in derogation of fundamental rights and as a consequence thereof, respondents cannot frame any law/rules/bye laws/regulations for its functioning which is inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights,” the plea said. It also said such discrimination by the Centre and the CISF cannot stand the test of “reasonable basis for treating equals differently” as laid down by the Supreme Court. While seeking a direction to recruit women to the posts in CISF on par with men, the plea also sought to know the steps taken by CISF towards gender equality. “Direct respondents (Centre and CISF) to inform this Court as to what steps it has taken towards Gender Equality in all posts in CISF,” plea said."

Addressing an event on the National Technology Day, which marks the 25th anniversary of the Pokhran tests, PM Modi said his government has used technology as a source of empowerment and to ensure social justice. The Prime Minister said the Pokhran nuclear tests carried out under the leadership of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee not only helped India prove its scientific capabilities but also gave a boost to its stature at the global level. “To say in Atal ji’s words: We have never stopped on our journey and never surrendered to any challenge that has come our way,” PM Modi said, addressing the gathering of scientists and researchers from across the country. On the occasion of the National Technology Day, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory – India (LIGO-India) and dedicated to the nation a facility to produce permanent magnets from rare earth minerals.

"Battle against ideologies in PoK, Gilgit-Baltistan",https://idrw.org/battle-against-ideologies-in-pok-gilgit-baltistan/,"May 12, 2023","SOURCE: ANI An ‘Age of Revolution’ is how the period between late 18th to mid-19th centuries is described by sociologists and political scientists as well as political economists. It was a period in modern history when revolutions took place in the Americas and Europe. It was during this period in history that absolute monarchies were brought down or their powers curtailed in favour of public representative governments and in some cases a written constitution was adopted. This was undoubtedly a period in history that gave birth to the modern concept of nation and nation-state. The industrial revolution in England, the Atlantic revolutions, Latin American revolutions resulted in the abolition of feudalism and the birth of the absolute hierarchy of trade and finance capital over the affairs of the state. Consensus among historians, social scientists and philosophers exist that all these revolutions began after a certain section of social strata got inspired by the new ideas that formed the political narrative known as Enlightenment. Enlightenment was a cultural/ideological rebellion against the decay of feudal socioeconomic production relations that paved the wave for industrial society. Similarly, Industrial society gave birth to a new cultural/ ideological representation among forces of production and was based on the theory that society was divided into two antagonist classes: the capitalist and the working classes. This led to the formation and crystallization of the ideology of Marxism. In Europe, Enlightenment gave rise to a social contract between the monarchy and the parliament as well as between the state and its subjects. The manifestation of this was western democracy. Marxism, on the other hand gave rise to horrific dictatorships in Russia and the central Asian states and in China and later in Eastern Europe and Cuba. The economic models of western democracy and the Marxist states were respectively two poles of economic extremes. One being based on free market and the other based on centralised and nationalized economies. Both have failed as they try to grapple with the cycle of economic crisis that is caused due to the unbridled pursuit of profit or in case of Marxist economies the strangulation of free enterprise. In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir including occupied Gilgit-Baltistan (PoK-GB), people have never had the freedom to flourish under either of the systems since both territories lacked big landlords or rich industrialists. The main economic activity in both territories to this day have been government employment or economic migration to the Middle East, Europe, West Asia or North America. The people of PoK-GB have never been in control of their destiny. They have depended on the ‘good will’ of the state of Pakistan and the occupying army for economic handouts. Therefore, psychologically they are more inclined toward the concept of fate and trust in Allah. This makes the majority of the population vulnerable to fall prey to ideologies of various kinds. The most dangerous ideology that my people have fallen victim to is radical jihadi Islam. During the 1960s, the upper intellectual strata of PoK was influenced by the Marxist ideology and a brief romance with the Chinese revolution and the idealism of guerrilla war as a legitimate tactic to gain freedom from Pakistan occupation became an obsession. The Marxist tradition simply refused to recognise the national question in PoK and made the cause of independence subservient to class struggle that was Pakistan-centric. However, during the early 1980s, when Pakistan started the Afghan-Jihad, things changed for the worst. Now the ideology of radical Islam was touted in PoK as a means to salvation and linked to Ghazwa-e-Hind. Again making the struggle for freedom from the colonial oppression of Pakistan subservient to the requirements of global Islamic jihad. Both, the ideology of Marxism and the ideology of radical Islam and jihad, have been instrumental in holding back our struggle for freedom from Pakistan and re-join with mother India. It has taken a long time for the young generation to come to terms with the fact that their relation with Pakistan is not that of equals but of master and subject. Over the past 4 years, social unrest and economic crisis has deepened their understanding of the colonial nature of their relation with Pakistan. Social media revolution has helped the young generation to explore the world wide web and look for answers to their miseries. They have realised that it is Pakistan which attacked their state and divided and occupied their lands. This realisation has brought a new life into the struggle for their salvation. Anti-Pakistan slogans have become the norm of any political or economic rights protest in PoK-GB. More and more young people want to join India and the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. It is under the threat of this new wave of radicalization that Pakistan has relaunched the Jamiat e Tuleba e Islam, a youth fascist organisation, in almost every college in the PoK. A conference to stress the finality of the prophet of Islam, Muhammed, was held on April 30 in Jhelum valley, another seminar under the title ‘Nizam e Mustafa’ is being planned for Mirpur city. Pakistan military officers are regularly giving lectures to high school students on the tenants of Islam and Jihad and a new jihadi organisation, Janbaz Force, has recently been launch. The purpose of the recent endeavour of raising the jihadi sentiment among the youth in PoK is to ‘re-educate’ them in the narrative of Jinnah’s two-nation theory and Islamic religious fascism. Islam as an ideological weapon is being presented to the youth of PoK as a way of salvation from the decaying socio-economic conditions of PoK. The truth of the matter is that occupation, plunder and loot of our natural resources is the root cause of our backward socio-economic condition. The way out of our misery is not hidden in the tenants of Islam but by rebelling against the occupation and becoming masters of our own natural resources.

China’s attempts to install friendly government in Nepal suffer setback: Report,https://idrw.org/chinas-attempts-to-install-friendly-government-in-nepal-suffer-setback-report/,"May 12, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Attempts by the Chinese leadership to install a Beijing-friendly government in Kathmandu have suffered setbacks, say specialists, according to South Asia Democratic Forum (SADF). The Communist Party of China (CPC) has for quite some time, ‘pushed for a united leftist party in Nepal that would enjoy widespread support and govern in the favour of officials in Beijing’. To do so, the CPC supported merging the ‘two largest communist parties to establish a strong communist force in Nepal’. The newly formed party which was called the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), comprised the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), headed by K P Sharma Oli, and the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-Maoist Centre) of former rebel leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal (also known as ‘Prachanda’). The unified communists under the banner of the NCP came to power in 2018. With this, it appeared that Beijing had successfully consolidated its influence in Kathmandu. However, the Communist ‘unity party’ was short-lived and split in March 2021. This led to the exit of the NCP from power and resulted in a government led by the Nepali Congress (NC). According to SADF, it is of course hard not to perceive the NCP split as a ‘a major setback to Beijing’s Nepal policy’. Under the then-new Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba (NC), the Nepali government’s criticism of India was toned down, another indicator of China’s declining influence in Kathmandu. It appeared that after the November 2022 general elections, Beijing was regaining some of the political space in Kathmandu it enjoyed under the NCP rule. Nepal witnessed the return of the CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre to power as part of a broader coalition. The withdrawal of the pro-Chinese CPN-UML from the current ruling coalition was however a major set-back for Beijing. To make things worse, the exit of the CPN-UML from the coalition was the consequence of a larger behind-the-scenes political manoeuvre by Prachanda. A presidential election took place earlier in 2023. Instead of supporting the candidate of his coalition partner, the PM decided to promote Ram Chandra Poudel from the opposition Nepali Congress. The takeover of the presidential office by Poudel marks another Chinese defeat. His predecessor, Bidhya Devi Bhandari, had a ‘discernible proclivity toward China’. Prachanda’s decision therefore led both to the drop-out of CPN-UML from the ruling coalition but also to the removal of a ‘”pro-Chinese” communist face in the supreme post’, according to Asian Lite."
“Will Reply To Every Step Taken Against India’s Dignity”: Rajnath Singh,https://idrw.org/will-reply-to-every-step-taken-against-indias-dignity-rajnath-singh/,"May 12, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday asserted that the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests gave a message to the world that although India is a peace-loving nation which believed in ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and ‘Ahimsa Paramo Dharma’, it will not let anyone harm the sovereignty, integrity and unity of the country. While addressing National Technology Day 2023, Rajnath Singh said, “India has not only wished for peace for itself but given the message to the world. Visionaries like Lord Buddha and Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi are India’s gift to the world. We have never invaded any country nor enslaved it. But, the Pokhran tests gave a message that we will give a befitting reply to every step taken against our dignity.” Mr Singh termed National Technology Day as an inspiration to adopt a scientific approach while acknowledging the country’s technological achievements. He underlined the importance of science in the progress of a nation, describing it as the source of power. He emphasised that the scientific approach motivates the youth to contribute to nation-building and ensures holistic development. The Raksha Mantri believed that India, passing through the phase of demographic dividend, possesses a powerful human resource, which has guided it to a respectable position on the world stage. He called for the optimum utilisation of this human resource to achieve the goal of a strong, prosperous and developed India. “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are moving forward with the resolve of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhan. We have risen in stature on the global stage and the world is witnessing a new ray of hope in India. We will be successful in realising our vision of building a strong and self-reliant ‘New India’,” Mr Singh stated."
Tejas MkII Program Funding to be Granted Only After GE414 ToT Clearance,https://idrw.org/tejas-mkii-program-funding-to-be-granted-only-after-ge414-tot-clearance/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: API As per a recent report by Janes Intel, India’s Tejas MkII program has hit a roadblock despite receiving clearance from the Indian Ministry of Defense’s (MOD) Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS). This is because one of the conditions set by the MOD was that GE would have to provide transfer of technology (ToT) for its GE F414 engine to the program, after which the funds would be released. This delay in the release of funds, which has now stretched beyond a year, could have significant repercussions for the program’s timeline. The program is now facing the possibility of further delays in the rollout of the prototype and the first flight. Given the complexity of modern fighter aircraft, engine technology is a crucial element that cannot be compromised. Therefore, it is crucial for the Indian MOD to provide the necessary funds for the program, so that the ToT can be obtained from GE, and the Tejas MkII can progress as planned. The success of this program is essential for India’s defense preparedness and technological advancements in the field of aerospace."

The aircraft was placed in front of a government building in Pakistan, and the incident occurred following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The F-6 Shenyang fighter jet was manufactured by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation of China and was the first purchase of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) from Beijing, setting the tone of defense relations between the two countries. The F-6 played a vital role in the defense of Pakistan and was instrumental in several successful missions. The PAF bid adieu to the F-6s in 2002, and since then, these aircraft have been on display as a symbol of Pakistan’s military prowess. The burning of the F-6 Shenyang fighter jet has sparked outrage among aviation enthusiasts and military personnel alike. The act is not only disrespectful to the aircraft but also to the brave pilots who risked their lives flying these planes in defense of the country. It is important to note that the F-6 Shenyang fighter jet is not just a machine but a symbol of Pakistan’s military history and defense capabilities. Destroying it only serves to undermine the country’s achievements and dishonor its brave defenders. In conclusion, the burning of the F-6 Shenyang fighter jet is a regrettable incident that should not have happened. It is a reminder that we must value and preserve our military history and honor the sacrifices of those who have defended our nation."

"US cuts China’s access to tools to make chips for computer servers, AI",https://idrw.org/us-cuts-chinas-access-to-tools-to-make-chips-for-computer-servers-ai/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The US has been cutting off China’s access to a growing number of tools to make chips for computer servers, artificial intelligence and other advanced applications, Directus reported. The US has been joined by Japan and Netherlands in limiting access to Beijing to technology that may be used to make weapons. The Joe Biden administration has through a series of legislations, further tightened restrictions. The previous Barack Obama administration had only stopped the access of China to chip technology that had advanced military uses. According to Directus, China has no way to retaliate against US companies either. Chinese industries import more than USD 300 billion worth of foreign chips every year to assemble smartphones, tablet computers and other consumer electronics. China has also been blocked from buying a machine available only from a Dutch company, ASML, that uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon chips on a scale measured in nanometres; the billionth part of a metre. It takes about 1,500 steps and technologies to make microprocessor chips. These technologies are owned by suppliers in the US Europe and Japan. The US is on top in its technological war with China, according to a study by the Observer Research Foundation. The US will strive to maintain its dominance, as evident by some of the most restrictive export control measures yet on China. The ability of the USA to persuade its partners such as the Netherlands and Japan to adopt similar measures would be of critical advantage to Washington as China would find it difficult to gain access to advanced semiconductor technology. Many of the US’ friends are world leaders in technology of major strategic or geopolitical importance such as semiconductors. For instance, Taiwan produces more than 90 per cent of the most advanced semiconductor computer chips in the world and ASML of the Netherlands produces 100 per cent of the most advanced lithography machines that are essential for computer chip factories."

ISRO Successfully Commences Testing Of Semi-Cryogenic Engine,https://idrw.org/isro-successfully-commences-testing-of-semi-cryogenic-engine/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The Indian Space Research Organisation has sucessfully commenced testing of its semi-cryogenic engines that would power future launch vehicles. The very first integrated test on an intermediate configuration of the 2000 kN (Kilonewton) semi-cryogenic engine carried out at the newly-commissioned Semicryogenic Integrated Engine & Stage Test facility at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC) at Mahendragiri in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday was successful, the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency said. The test is a step towards developing a 2000 kN thrust engine, which works on Liquid Oxygen (LOX)-Kerosene propellant combination, for future launch vehicles, an ISRO statement said. The intermediate configuration, designated as Power Head Test Article (PHTA), comprises all the engine systems except the thrust chamber. It was the first of a series of tests planned to validate the design of the propellant feed system, including the low-pressure and high-pressure turbo-pumps, the gas generator, and control components. The Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) of ISRO has undertaken the design & development of a semi-cryogenic engine with 2000 kN thrust with Indian industry participation, and it will power the booster stages of future launch vehicles. Wednesday’s test is a major milestone before integrating the complete engine and its qualification, ISRO said. “This test demonstrated the complex chill-down operations spanning about 15 hours duration that was conducted successfully, meeting all the required conditions for engine start. After the chill down of the LOX circuit, the feed circuit of kerosene was filled, and LOX was admitted into the gas generator by opening the injection valve. Successful performance of the test article helps derive the sequence of operations for further tests,” it said. The new facility at IPRC with a state-of-the-art Programmable Logic Controllers-based control system and data acquisition system, is capable of testing semi-cryogenic engines up to 2600 kN thrust and will support the subsequent testing and qualification of the fully integrated semi-cryogenic engine and stage, ISRO said. This test, the space agency said, has demonstrated the successful performance of the test facility and PHTA in the first attempt itself.According to ISRO, the Semi Cryogenic Propulsion System Project envisages the design and development of a 2000 kN semi-cryogenic engine and ‘SC120 stage’ that will enable the development of a heavy-lift capability for future Indian space transportation systems."

Vikram Doraiswami made the remarks as he met the soldiers of India and the UK who are participating in Exercise Ajeya Warrior. Contingents from the British and Indian Armies have been undertaking training at the Salisbury Plain Training Area in the UK for the past two weeks. This year, Exercise Ajeya Warrior involved troops from the UK’s 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team and 2nd Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles and India’s 6th Battalion of the Bihar Regiment. Speaking to ANI, Vikram Doraiswami said, “The purpose of this opportunity is to try and increase interoperability between the armies and also to learn from each other. There is something that the British Army could learn from us and given the quality and experience of the British Army’s planning processes, there are things that our people could learn from them.” Doraiswami said that Exercise Ajeya Warrier is a “flagship exercise” between the armies of India and the UK. He said, “Exercise Ajeya Warrior is our flagship exercise between our two armies. It’s a biennial exercise and the purpose of this opportunity is to try and increase, of course, interoperability between the armies, but also to learn from each other. And as our British colleagues were telling us, one part, of course, is that there are similarities in the way we operate, in the way we are soldiers and men interact, which allows the two armies to integrate faster, which is really good to start an exercise.” He noted that there are differences in the way the army executes its instructions. He said that the Indian army could learn from the British army considering their plan and processes. Doraiswami said, “there’s also differences in the way things the army actually executes its instructions because of the difference in the scale of the army. Of course, there is some that the British army could learn from us. And of course, given the quality and experience of the British army’s planning processes, etc, there are things that our people could learn. And that, frankly, is the whole idea. Our army should be always at the top of its game. It should always be at the height of professionalism and everything that helps improve our skills is what the government and the nation should be able to do to invest in the army’s skilling processes. So, it’s a success in that sense.” Speaking about his interaction with the soldiers of both sides, Vikram Doraiswami said, “I think the most touching part is the fact that the British Gurkha Regiment here and the Bihar Regiment soldiers, of course, have a lot in common, including Bollywood songs and language and cultural sort of frameworks of reference. But even with the Royal Irish unit that has been part of the exercise, I think the fact that they could bond so well suggests that our differences as people, as human beings, across cultures are actually much smaller than we think.” Colonel NS Rathor, Indian Contingent Commander for Joint Indo-UK Exercise, said that the boys of the Indian Army have done well. He said that the exercise has given an ideal platform for sharing the drills and best practices of operation in urban and semi-urban environments. Speaking to ANI, Colonel NS Rathor said, “This Indo-UK Joint Exercise has given an ideal platform for sharing the drills and best practices of operation in urban and semi-urban environments. The Exercise has achieved the desired level of outcomes and has set new standards of the joint venture and interoperability between both armies.” Speaking about the exercise, Brigadier Nick said, “On this particular exercise, not only have we been training two of our battle groups, we’ve also been training with our Indian brothers. We have a very strong shared history and strategic partnership with India, but what’s been really impressive is how quickly the tactical relationship has built among us.” Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India, said, “The UK and India are natural partners in defence and have increasing levels of interoperability, as shown by this highly complex and hands-on interaction between our militaries. The UK has made the Indo-Pacific ’tilt’ a permanent pillar of our international policy. The region is critical to our economy, our security, and to our interest in an open and stable international order.”"

President Biden will host Prime Minister Modi for an Official State Visit to the United States, which will include a state dinner, on June 22, the White House announced on Wednesday. “The upcoming visit will affirm the deep and close partnership between the US and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement while announcing the visit. India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI that Prime Minister Modi’s forthcoming official state visit to the US, at the invitation of President Biden, is “historic”. “Prime Minister and President Biden have together imparted significantly new vigour and momentum to our bilateral ties. The visit will be an opportunity for the two leaders to spend time together, take stock of the progress achieved and provide guidance on the future limitless possibilities,” he said. “The visit will also underscore that India-US partnership is people-centric and people-driven and that it is not just for the two countries, but for the world at large,” Mr Sandhu said. White House Press Secretary Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday the visit will strengthen the two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and shared resolve to elevate the strategic technology partnership, including in defence, clean energy, and space. The US, India and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China’s rising military manoeuvring in the resource-rich region. China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea. China also has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea. China and its diplomats have been attacking the Indo-Pacific concept from the beginning claiming that it is aimed at containing Beijing. “The leaders will discuss ways to further expand our educational exchanges and people-to-people ties, as well as our work together to confront common challenges from climate change to workforce development and health security,” Jean-Pierre said. The White House’s announcement on Biden’s invitation to Modi has been widely welcomed. “I am delighted that the White House has invited the Prime Minister for a state visit which will help strengthen the strategic partnership between our nations,” Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna told PTI. Khanna is the Co-Chair of the Congressional India Caucus, the largest country-specific caucus in the House of Representatives. Mukesh Aghi, president of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum, said Modi’s visit in June will be a wonderful opportunity to elevate the bilateral partnership to the next level. “President Biden and Prime Minister Modi will be meeting in a few weeks’ time at the Quad Leader’s Summit in Australia and later this year at the G20 in India. Both leaders have used minilaterals such as the Quad, I2U2, and the G20 summits to work on common goals,” Aghi said. “However, the state visit will provide a valuable and timely opportunity for both Washington and New Delhi to strengthen the edifice of this strategic partnership and work on enhancing commercial ties, building resilient supply chains, and creating new synergies in the critical and emerging technology domain,” he said. Atul Keshap, president of US India Business Council, said the invitation is a big diplomatic gesture from the United States. “India was last honoured with a State Visit in 2009. That PM Modi is being honoured with only the third State Visit of the Biden Administration shows the respect and affection the American people have for a rising India,” he said.

Aparna Pande, from the Hudson Institute think-tank, said India is key to the security, diplomatic, and commercial architecture that the United States is building across the Indo Pacific. “For the Modi government also, a stronger strategic partnership with the United States is critical to boosting India’s leverage in the global arena,” Pande said."
Relationship with India is Important and Needs to Be Built: White House,https://idrw.org/relationship-with-india-is-important-and-needs-to-be-built-white-house/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: PTI US President Joe Biden believes that America’s relationship with India is important and needs to be built, his spokesperson said, noting that the administration continues to engage with senior Indian officials on human rights issues. “This is a president who has had decades of experience in leader-to-leader relationships. This is an important relationship as we speak about the Indo-Pacific, as we talk about how to move forward in that region,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden headed to New York. “And so, the president believes this is an important relationship that we need to continue and build on. As it relates to human rights, as I just laid out, this is a conversation that we have with other nations around the world. The president never shies away to have that conversation with leaders,” Jean-Pierre said. The Press Secretary was responding to a question on the White House announcement earlier in the day about the Official State visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 22. “Are the optics problematic for the White House, with the White House giving India sort of the honour of a state visit when there are obvious human rights concerns under Prime Minister Modi and the fact that there are clear differences between the US and India when it comes to Russia and Ukraine?” she was asked. “As we do with other nations around the world, we regularly engage with Indian government officials at senior levels on human rights concerns, including freedom of religion or belief. That is something that the president regularly does. We encourage all countries to uphold their human rights obligations, and commitments, and to work towards building inclusive societies,” Jean-Pierre said. Earlier, she told reporters aboard Air Force One that Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will host Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an Official State Visit to the United States, which will include a state dinner, on June 22. The upcoming visit will affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together, she said. “The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defence, clean energy, and space. The leaders will discuss ways to further expand our educational exchanges and people-to-people ties, as well as our work together to confront common challenges from climate change to workforce development and health security,” Jean-Pierre said. Atul Keshap, the president of the US-India Business Council, said that a State Visit is a big diplomatic gesture for the United States. “India was last honoured with a State Visit in 2009. That PM Modi is being honoured with only the third State Visit of the Biden Administration shows the respect and affection the American people have for a rising India,” he told PTI. “It is entirely good and proper that the world’s two greatest democracies further cement their strategic, economic, and technology convergence in these turbulent geostrategic times. The State Visit will remind the world that India and America still have so much more potential to capture in our bilateral relations, reflecting the energy and talent of our demographics and our systems, which serve to empower our free peoples,” Keshap said. “The announcement by the White House of the upcoming Official State Visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June of this year demonstrates the strategic bet that the Biden administration has placed on its partnership with India. India is key to the security, diplomatic, and commercial architecture that the United States is building across the Indo-Pacific,” said Aparna Pande, from the Hudson Institute think-tank. “For the Modi government also, a stronger strategic partnership with the United States is critical in boosting India’s leverage in the global arena,” Pande said."

The police did not elaborate on the motive but said they will investigate the “entire deep-rooted conspiracy” and examine possible connections of those arrested, in India and abroad. The latest blast occurred on Wednesday midnight in Galiara, the pathway and park around the Golden Temple, behind the Guru Ramdas Ji Niwas (inn) building, they said. Director-General of Police Gaurav Yadav told reporters that the police will look into whether the explosions were the work of a self-radicalised module or it acted on the directions of someone else. He said a Special Investigations Team will be formed to probe into the matter. “We will investigate the entire deep-rooted conspiracy behind this. We will examine all the associates of the arrested people, in India and abroad, and get to the bottom of it,” he said. The arrested accused have been identified as Azadvir Singh, Amrik Singh, Sahib Singh, Harjit Singh and Dharminder Singh. Azadvir and Amrik were the main perpetrators while Sahib, Harjit and Dharminder sourced and supplied the explosives, he said. Amrik’s wife is also being questioned and her role examined, said the police chief. A low-intensity blast took place near the Golden Temple here late in the night, the third such incident in this holy city in a week, the police said. On May 6, a low-intensity explosion occurred on a heritage street near the Golden Temple. The second one took place in the area less than 30 hours after the first blast. The police also recovered 1.10 kg low-intensity explosives, which is normally used to make firecrackers, Yadav said. Sharing more details, Yadav said the first improvised explosive device (IED) was assembled in the bathroom of the inn on May 6 and it constituted 200 grams of explosives, which are normally used to make firecrackers, in two energy drink cans. A metallic tiffin box was also filled with the same explosive material. “All three containers were placed in a polythene bag. Azadvir had gone to the rooftop of the heritage parking building and then hung the polythene bag with the help of a rope at 11 pm on May 6. The first explosion took place at 11.25 pm,” Yadav said. The second IED was assembled by using two metallic bowls that were then joined together in the bathroom of the inn on May 7. It was placed on the top of the heritage parking building at 4.30 am on May 8 and exploded at 6.15 am, he said. The third explosion took place in a secluded area behind the inn building. Yadav also thanked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee for their cooperation in nabbing the accused."

The NIA wants to identify their exact location to initiate the extradition proceedings. The Special NIA court in Delhi had issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against them due to their non appearances in the matter. The case involves Khalistani outfits like Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), and International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), along with north India-based gangsters. They are suspected of being involved in terror attacks, arms and drug smuggling from Pakistan using drones, targeted assassinations, and extorting money from industrialists, businessmen, and professionals."

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a state-owned aerospace and defence company, confirmed that the company’s Director (Finance), Ananthakrishnan, HAL plans to roll out a prototype by September 2025, exactly 36 months from the CCS clearance, and the first flight is scheduled for 2026. There are plans for three additional prototypes of the LCA Mk-2 fighter, which will be rolled out with an eight-month gap between each. Initially, the LCA Mk2 Project Director at Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), Dr V Madhusudana Rao, announced that four prototypes would be used for complete flight testing and weapon testing, with testing concluding by the end of 2027 so that production could begin in 2028. However, according to sources familiar with recent developments, the timeline for the LCA Mk2 aircraft entering production is likely to be pushed further to 2030 onwards. Two years is too short of a duration to complete both flight testing and weapon testing, as the first two years may be required solely to obtain initial flight certification for the aircraft. Even with basic weapons clearance, weapon testing will take two or more years. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is aware of unrealistic production timelines often given by ADA/DRDO officials. Consequently, the IAF is considering purchasing 50 more Tejas Mk1A aircraft that will extend the production line until at least 2030. The IAF has identified the LCA Mk2 as a crucial component that will eventually fill a critical gap in the fighter squadrons of the Indian Air Force as the MiG-29, Mirage 2000, and Jaguar fleets retire over the next decade."

I would have been equally angry if it would have happened to our high commission,” he said addressing an event organised by the Ananta Centre here. Ellis was referring to the vandalism at the Indian High Commission in London in March this year by pro-Khalistan groups who pulled down the tricolour and damaged the mission. He further said that India and the United Kingdom (UK) were capable of dealing with disagreements, but in case of Khalistani extremism, “there was no disagreement”. “In case of extremism, in specific Khalistani extremism, I think there is no disagreement. What happened at the Indian High Commission was absolutely not okay. It is a symptom of an issue which is Khalistani extremism,” he said. “We look at extremism not in relationship with a particular group of people, but overall extremism is a risk in any country. It certainly is a risk in mine,” Ellis said. The High Commissioner noted that the UK government had a “toolkit” for dealing with disinformation and radicalisation at religious institutions. At the same time, Ellis said it was necessary to keep “eyes on the prize” of closer India-UK strategic relationship. He also spoke about clinching the bilateral Free Trade Agreement soon before the two countries move into their respective election cycles in 2024 and 2025."
Anti-Terror Agency Raid In Delhi In Case Linked To Kerala Train Fire,https://idrw.org/anti-terror-agency-raid-in-delhi-in-case-linked-to-kerala-train-fire/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The National Investigation Agency (NIA) today conducted searches in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh in this year’s April 2 Elathur train arson attack case. The agency sleuths carried out the searches since this morning and the raids are still underway at the locations of suspects. The NIA carried out searches at the hideouts of suspects in the case which was taken over by the anti-terror agency almost a month ago and it started its probe charging the “highly radicalised” arrested accused Shahrukh Safi. The agency took over the case from Kerala Police in mid-April following an order issued by the Counter Terrorism and Counter Radicalization (CTCR) division under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). As it was a clear case of terror involving many states, the NIA invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act based on doubts that the accused was sent to the state by his handlers and he got enough local help. The NIA’s action comes days after the accused, identified as one Shahrukh Saifi, who also suffered burn injuries during the terror act, was slapped with murder charges under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code by a district session court in Kozhikode. He was charged with murder in a case filed by the railway police. As per officials, there was a preplanned conspiracy behind the crime and it was not a single-man mission as confessed by the accused.Saifi, 27, a native of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, was arrested by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of Maharashtra police and Central Intelligence after the train arson attack case. He had also suffered injuries in the attack. At the time of interrogation by a special investigation team (SIT) Saifi provided contradictory statements in which initially, he had said he was being used by someone and later retracted saying, everything was planned and executed by him only. The NIA is investigating the larger conspiracy as part of which Saifi, assessed by Kerala police to be “highly radicalised” and influenced by inflammatory speeches of Islamic evangelist Zakir Naik, planned and executed the act of arson. The NIA is also looking at possible handlers and aides that may have been part of this conspiracy and it is also examining the inter-state linkages, considering that Saifi is a resident of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and was arrested from Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. The NIA has been involved in the train arson case right from the start and engaged in an investigation with officers from its Kochi branch.The agency officers also reached the incident site soon after the attack to examine the cause of the fire and collect samples for forensic analysis. On April 2, Saifi had attempted to set some passengers on fire on board the Alappuzha-Kannur Executive Express at Elathur in Kozhikode, after spraying them with an inflammable liquid. Three passengers lost their lives while trying to jump out of the train to escape the fire. Saifi was later arrested from Ratnagiri."

The FRCV project aims to phase out the T-72 Main Battle Tanks supplied by the Soviet Union from 2030 onward. While the Indian Army has prioritized the creation of a Light Tank for high altitude regions to keep up with Chinese firepower, Project Zorwar will also provide vital insights for the FRCV’s development. The FRCV will integrate advancements in asymmetric technologies and address emerging threats against armored formations. The Army is seeking a cutting-edge battle tank platform that not only outmatches its predecessors but also integrates specialized technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and see-through armor while functioning within a “network-centric environment.” The new tanks must operate continuously day and night, possess all-terrain agility and high mobility, offer lethal firepower with pinpoint accuracy, and provide multi-layered protection through niche technologies. To meet the Army’s requirements, the next generation battle tank must have long detection and identification ranges with thermal night vision and “lock on target” capabilities, as well as smoke dischargers with anti-thermal and laser capabilities. The Army is also seeking an automated loading system that requires minimal intervention and engagement time, with the added advantage of being lightweight for optimal operations. The tank must also be equipped with “soft kill systems” and other countermeasures, including laser warning systems and RF sensors."
‘Jeopardized Communal Harmony’: 9 People Convicted In 2020 Delhi Riots Case,https://idrw.org/jeopardized-communal-harmony-9-people-convicted-in-2020-delhi-riots-case/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: PTI A court in Delhi has sentenced nine persons convicted in a case pertaining to the 2020 northeast Delhi riots to seven years of rigorous imprisonment, observing that communal riot is a menace that poses a serious threat to the sense of fraternity among the citizens. The court also said the acts of the convicts left a deep scar on the social fabric, economy and stability of the country, besides instilling a sense of insecurity among the people and jeopardizing the communal harmony in the society. Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala on Tuesday pronounced the order, sentencing Mohd Shahnawaz, Mohd Shoaib, Shahrukh, Rashid, Azad, Ashraf Ali Parvez, Mohd Faisal and Rashid. On March 13, the court had convicted the nine accused, saying the charges levelled by the prosecution were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”All the convicts shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years for the offence punishable under Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house etc.) of the Indian Penal Code and each convict shall pay a fine of ? 20,000,” the judge said. The ASJ also said from the recovered fine, ? 1.5 lakh would be disbursed to the complainant or victim as compensation and in default of payment of the fine, each convict would undergo simple imprisonment for one year and six months. “Communal riot is that menace, which poses a serious threat to the sense of fraternity among the citizens of our nation. Communal riots are treated as one of the most violent forms of public disorder that afflicts society and leads to not only loss of life and property but also causes great damage to the social fabric,” the judge said. He said during communal riots, innocent and ordinary people get caught in circumstances beyond their control, which also leads to the violation of human rights in the present case, the convicts indulged in communal riots, which impacted the mindset of people both within and beyond the territorial limits where the act was committed. “Thus, the impact of the crime committed by the convicts, in this case, is not limited to loss caused to the complainant only. Rather their acts left a deep scar on the social fabric, economy and stability of our nation and the alleged acts instilled a sense of insecurity among the people while jeopardizing the communal harmony in the society,” the judge said. Noting that the defence counsel referred to reformation and sought a lenient approach in sentencing, the judge said the repercussion of crime in the case does not allow invoking the reformatory theory of sentence. “Moreover, though reformation is the most ideal aim, but even for that purpose there must be some indication appearing from the conduct of the convict and it cannot be demanded just to escape the consequences of misdeeds,” the ASJ said. In the present case, the sentence must be based on the consideration of balancing the impact of crime on the society and background of the convicts, the judge added. The court also noted that the nine people were held guilty of the charges of forming an unlawful assembly with the object of causing maximum damage to people of a particular community, besides instilling fear and insecurity in their minds, and in pursuance of their common object, the convicts committed vandalism, theft and mischief by fire in the complainant’s house in Chaman Park area on the intervening night of February 24 and 25, 2020. During the proceedings, Special Public Prosecutor D K Bhatia sought maximum punishment, saying a message should go to the masses by giving severe punishment to the convicts. A charge sheet was filed at Gokulpuri police station against the accused under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon) 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc.) 427 (punishment for committing mischief and thereby causing loss or damage to the amount of ? 50 or upwards) 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 436 of the IPC."

Brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar, Abdul Rauf, born in 1974 in Pakistan, has been involved in planning and executing numerous terror strikes in India including the hijacking of Indian Airlines aircraft IC814 in 1999, the attack on the Parliament in 2001 and the targeting of the IAF base in Pathankot in 2016. It is learnt that China objected to the proposal from India to add Abdul Rauf of the JeM to the UN Security Council’s 1267 ISIL and Al Qaida Sanctions list. Rauf Azhar was sanctioned by the US in December 2010. In August last year, China, a permanent, veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, had put a hold on the proposal by India and the US to designate Rauf Azhar as a global terrorist and subject him to assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo. Beijing, an all-weather friend of Islamabad, had last year put holds on proposals to blacklist Pakistan-based terrorists Hafiz Talah Saeed, Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Shahid Mahmood and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba terrorist Sajid Mir under the Al Qaeda Sanctions regime. In June last year, China put a hold on a joint proposal by India and the US to designate Abdul Rehman Makki, the deputy chief of Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba under the 1267 sanctions committee. In January this year however, Makki, the head of the political affairs wing of JuD/LeT and the brother-in-law of LeT chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, was designated a global terrorist by the UN after China lifted its hold on the joint India-US proposal to blacklist him, paving the way for the Security Council’s Al Qaeda sanctions committee to list him through consensus. During India’s Presidency of the UN Security Council in December 2022, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called out Pakistan and China in his remarks to the Council briefing on ‘Global Counterterrorism Approach: Challenges and Way Forward’, saying the “contemporary epicentre of terrorism” remains very much active and “evidence-backed proposals” to blacklist terrorists under sanctions regimes are put on hold without assigning adequate reason. “At one level, we have seen protections that come close to justification. Then, there are evidence-backed proposals that are put on hold without assigning adequate reason. Conversely, there has even been recourse to anonymity so as to avoid taking ownership of untenable cases,” Jaishankar had said. The US Department of Treasury had in December 2010 designated “Abdul Rauf Azhar, a senior leader of Jaish-e Mohammed (JEM), for acting for or on behalf of JEM.” The US said as a senior leader of JeM, Abdul Rauf Azhar has urged Pakistanis to engage in militant activities. He served as JEM’s acting leader in 2007, as one of JEM’s most senior commanders in India, and as JEM’s intelligence coordinator. In 2008 Azhar was assigned to organize suicide attacks in India. He was also involved with JEM’s political wing and has served as a JEM official involved with training camps.”"

"China finally has a rival as the world’s factory floor, India: Report",https://idrw.org/china-finally-has-a-rival-as-the-worlds-factory-floor-india-report/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Western companies are desperately looking for a backup to China as the world’s factory floor, a strategy widely termed “China plus one.” India is making a concerted push to be the plus one. Only India has a labour force and an internal market comparable in size to China’s. India’s population may be the world’s largest, according to the United Nations, Wall Street Journal reported. Western governments see democratic India as a natural partner, and the Indian government has pushed to make the business environment more friendly than in the past. It scored a coup with the decision by Apple to significantly expand iPhone production in India, including expediting the manufacturing of its most advanced model. Signs that India is changing are visible in the sprawling industrial parks in Sriperumbudur, a city in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, WSJ reported. Foreign manufacturers here have long churned out cars and appliances for the Indian market. They’re now being joined by multinational corporations making goods from solar panels and wind turbines to toys and footwear, all looking for an alternative to China. In 2021 Denmark’s Vestas, one of the world’s largest wind-turbine manufacturers, built two new factories in Sriperumbudur. Its six assembly lines now assemble hub cells, power trains and other components, stacked high in a storage yard to be shipped across the world, WSJ reported. Forecasts that India would soon become the second-largest market for turbines sparked Vestas’s expansion. But it was also a conscious effort to diversify away from China, which hosted the bulk of its regional production, especially after repeated lockdowns under Beijing’s zero-Covid policy, said Charles McCall, who oversaw the expansion as senior director of Vestas Assembly India. “We don’t want all our eggs in one basket in China,” he said. Some of Vestas’s suppliers have joined it. American contract manufacturer TPI Composites moulds 260-foot-long turbine blades that regularly draw attention as they are shuttled along surrounding highways. It has expanded significantly in India even as it reduces operations in China. Eventually, 85 per cent of Vestas’s suppliers will be in India, said McCall, who recently left the company. China still towers over every other country in global manufacturing, a position it cemented when multinationals flooded in after it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. But a growing list of factors has prompted companies to search for a backup. First, there were rising labour costs in China and pressure from the Chinese government to transfer technology to Chinese competitors. Then there were President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, Covid lockdowns from 2020 through last year, and now a push by Western governments to decouple their economies from China. Many countries are competing to be the “plus one,” with Vietnam, Mexico, Thailand and Malaysia in particular contention. India must still overcome entrenched problems that have kept it a bit player in global supply chains. Its labour force remains mostly poor and unskilled, infrastructure is underdeveloped and the business climate, including regulations, can be burdensome. Manufacturing remains small relative to the size of India’s economy. Nonetheless, after decades of disappointment, it is making progress. Its manufactured exports were barely a tenth of China’s in 2021, but they exceeded all other emerging markets except Mexico’s and Vietnam’s, according to World Bank data. The biggest gains have been in electronics, where exports have tripled since 2018 to USD 23 billion in the year through March. India has gone from making 9 per cent of the world’s smartphone handsets in 2016 to a projected 19 per cent this year, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Foreign direct investment into India averaged USD 42 billion annually from 2020 to 2022, a doubling in under a decade, according to central-bank figures. Since China declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine last year, the US and its allies have stepped up efforts to reduce dependence on China. Through reducing dependence on China. Through “friend-shoring,” the US is “strengthening integration with our many trusted trading partners- including India,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on a visit there in February. No company better embodies the bet on India as the next China than Apple. Over the past 15 years, the company built up a state-of-the-art supply chain almost entirely in China to make its laptops, iPhones and accessories. Its presence helped the entire manufacturing sector in China. The California-based company has assembled low-end iPhone models in India since 2017 and began making its newest, flagship iPhone 14 here within weeks of its launch last year. J.P. Morgan estimates a quarter of all Apple iPhones will be made in India by 2025. Indian officials hope Apple’s presence will spur others to come. “Very often you have anchor companies who set the trend,” Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said in an interview. “We believe that this will send a strong signal…to other companies in Europe, America and Japan.” Apple has been pushing suppliers to diversify beyond China after many faced production disruptions during Covid lockdowns. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions have been growing between the US and China and between Beijing and Taiwan, where Foxconn Technology Group, Apple’s main manufacturer, is based. Foxconn is set to expand production of iPhones at its existing plant near the Indian city of Chennai. It aims to boost iPhone production to around 20 million units annually by 2024 and roughly triple the number of workers to as many as 100,000, according to people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal has reported. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. India has made progress in overcoming some barriers to business. In 2014 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled “Make in India,” an effort to boost manufacturing. India has digitized many government services and accelerated the construction of railroads, airports, container shipping ports, and electricity generation. Piyush Goyal pointed to India’s rise on the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings and the World Intellectual Property Organization’s global innovation index and a growing number of free trade pacts as evidence “we have now taken…integrating ourselves with other countries far more seriously.” India introduced tax and customs rebates for exports in 2015 and overhauled them in 2021. The customs rebates were “the trigger point for the entire electronic industry,” said Sasikumar Gendham, managing director of Finland’s Salcomp, the world’s largest maker of smartphone chargers and supplier to Apple. Since 2014, Salcomp’s Indian workforce has increased sixfold to 12,000 and it aims to hire 25,000 people in the next two years. With 200 buses to transport workers and plans to build dormitories for 15,000 people, the company’s campus is massive by Indian standards, though not yet by Chinese standards. The facility churns out yet by Chinese standards. The facility churns out about 100 million units every year, compared with its China facility which produces about 180 million units. For all this progress, it isn’t clear it’s enough to set India apart. Jules Shih, a Chennai-based director of Taiwan’s trade promotion agency, TAITRA, said India has become an easier place to do business, but in many respects still lags behind other countries. It can take longer to get land and approvals to set up a factory in India and getting visas for expatriate technicians, managers and engineers is time-consuming, Shih said. “We feel they don’t have a united goal integrated across agencies to make Make in India happen faster,” he said. In March 2020, India introduced “production-linked incentives” that directly subsidize targeted products, starting with mobile phones and components, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Some companies have found the process to claim production-linked incentives to be burdensome. South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics has been in discussions with authorities over the amount of the rebate. A Samsung India spokesman said the company is committed to being a partner of India and working to make the plan a success. Labour shortages are emerging in India’s manufacturing hubs, local officials and businesses say. That’s because, unlike in China, many workers are reluctant to relocate long distances in search of work. Trade unions are more potent in India than in China. Work Trade unions are more vital in India than in China. China encouraged foreign companies to locate supply chains in special economic zones with reduced tariffs on imported components and machinery. By contrast, “Make in India” sought to replace imports with domestically manufactured products by raising import tariffs. Those tariffs discourage industries that import many components. “India is protectionist in precisely those sectors, goods manufacturing, where the China+1 opportunity arises,” Viral Acharya, an economist at New York University and former deputy governor of India’s central bank, wrote in a report for the Brookings Institution released in March. In its annual review of India’s economy last December, the International Monetary Fund said its integration into global value chains has stalled. Manufacturing’s share of Indian economic output has actually shrunk since Make in India was launched, to 14 per cent in 2021, far below that of Mexico, Vietnam and Bangladesh. Arvind Subramanian, who was Modi’s chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018, said for every company such as Apple that has embraced India, several report bad experiences. Even Apple’s investment “wouldn’t have happened without the push from China,” he said. Amazon.com closed some of its Indian ventures last fall. “We continue to develop and grow the local e-commerce ecosystem,” Amazon said in a statement. commerce ecosystem,” Amazon said in a statement. China’s experience suggests creating lots of moderately paid jobs for less-educated rural workers, especially women, requires manufacturing. In Tamil Nadu, a homegrown unicorn, Ola Electric, embodies those hopes. India is the world’s largest market for two-wheeled motorcycles and scooters, and Ola has made a splash with its brightly painted scooters catering to the demand for electric vehicles. New registrations for electric two-wheelers have grown more than tenfold over the past two years to 684,273 in the latest financial year that ended March 31, according to the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based think tank. Ola is making half a million electric scooters a year from its new plant. It plans to quadruple factory floor space, including two acres reserved for an indoor forest. The company says it will start making electric cars in early 2024. The airy plant has an almost all-female workforce, from security guards to workers wielding spray guns of paint, to those who test-ride the final product. “Initially, their parents were hesitant to let them work in factories,” said Jayaraman G, Ola’s associate director of corporate affairs. “No more. In the last year, they saw how the situation changed financially-from paying for the education of their siblings to helping build two- or three-room apartments. It’s a proud moment for their families.”"

Jaishankar Says ‘Stop Looking For a China Fix’ for Indian Economic Growth,https://idrw.org/jaishankar-says-stop-looking-for-a-china-fix-for-indian-economic-growth/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Indian economic growth cannot be built on Chinese efficiency and there is a need for businesses to stop looking for a “China fix”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday while strongly calling for boosting the domestic manufacturing sector. In an address at a book release event, Jaishankar said no major country in the world has sustained or enhanced its global position without building up on manufacturing and India too needs to focus on this. The external affairs minister also said that India should not allow a level-playing field for others who subsidise their production and that it must not let “other businesses” enjoy advantages in the country at the expense of “our own”. Jaishankar was speaking at the launch of ‘Made In India: 75 Years Of Business and Enterprise’ authored by G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant. The minister said the government gives priority to building deep manufacturing supply chains and noted that he sees ‘Make in India’ not just as an economic or manufacturing programme but as a strategic statement. “I think this country will never be a great country if it is not a great manufacturer. I think that is something we need to understand,” the external affairs minister said. “I think we need to stop looking for a China fix. That Indian growth cannot be built on Chinese efficiency. “If you are really to sustain and take the economy to a different level, we have to create a kind of domestic vendor chains that a serious manufacturing economy will do,” he said. “I know that it is not something which will happen overnight but I can tell you as someone in the government, someone in the economic affairs cabinet committee, we take as a priority that how do you build deep manufacturing supply chains which will be needed to do that,” Jaishankar said. He said the rolling out of the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) was part of the government’s efforts to energise the economy and motivate businesses to believe that it is possible to manufacture in this country. “There is no major country in the world which has sustained or enhanced its global position without some commensurate build-up on manufacturing. “I always believed that this focus on services was actually an elegant excuse for being incompetent in manufacturing,” he said. The external affairs minister also spoke on the need to support the domestic manufacturing sector. “In the name of opening the economy and globalisation, we should not end up de-industrialising this country. We should not allow level-playing fields in this country for others who subsidised their production. That is not a level playing field. That is economic suicide,” he said. “We need to be clear. Every country must support its manufacturers, must support its businesses. We must not let other businesses enjoy advantages in our country at the expense of our own,” he added. Jaishankar said strong business is not only about economics, but also a critical segment of national security. “I fully accept there are experiences and analogies that we can take, best practices we can take from the rest of the world. But at the end of the day we will have to think through our growth strategy for ourselves,” he said. “We will have to think through solutions to difficulties for ourselves. If you look at the last decade, every time we have actually confronted a major challenge,” he said. Referring to challenges faced by India during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jaishankar said the government received advice from abroad on how to economically handle the pandemic. “Honestly I would say I am glad we did not listen to much of it. I think how you come up with your own solutions, that is something which is important,” he said. The external affairs minister said it is important for India to move to a “strategic economy; have a clear sense who are our partners, where are our opportunities, where should we focus on our technology tie-ups.” He also mentioned the phrase that “war is too serious to be left to the generals” to emphasise that ”sometimes actually business or economics is also too serious to be left to the businessmen and economists.” “It is important to have a larger strategic direction. To my mind, I see ‘Make in India’ not as an economic programme, not as a manufacturing programme, I actually see it as a strategic statement,” he said. In his remarks, Kant spoke about various aspects of the India growth story and the way ahead."
Technology Day: PM Modi To Lay Foundation Of Gravity Observatory LIGO-India Tomorrow,https://idrw.org/technology-day-pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-of-gravity-observatory-ligo-india-tomorrow/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory – India (LIGO-India) on Thursday, when the country celebrates the 25th anniversary of the Pokhran-II nuclear tests. PM Modi will also dedicate to the nation a Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Plant at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre campus at Visakhapatnam and a Fission Moly-99 Production Facility in Mumbai, to produce the radioisotope used in more than 85 per cent of imaging procedures for early detection of cancer and heart disease. May 11 marks the 25th anniversary of the 1998 nuclear tests carried out at Pokhran test range, including its first test of a thermonuclear device, which has since been celebrated as the National Technology Day to honour scientists, engineers and technologists who made the tests possible. The prime minister will lay the foundation stone and dedicate to the nation multiple projects related to scientific and technological advancement in the country, worth more than ? 5,800 crore, an official statement said. The projects whose foundation stone would be laid include Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory – India (LIGO-India), Hingoli; Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jatni, Odisha; and Platinum Jubilee Block of Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. Last month, the Union Cabinet gave its nod to a project to construct and set up a LIGO-India at an estimated cost of ? 2,600 crore which is likely to be completed by 2030. LIGO-India will be an advanced gravitational-wave observatory to be located in India as part of a worldwide network. It is envisaged as a collaborative project between a consortium of Indian research institutions and the LIGO Laboratory in the USA, along with its international partners. LIGO-India had received the government’s in-principle approval in February 2016. Since then, the project reached several milestones towards selecting and acquiring a site and building the observatory. The United States will provide key components for the lab worth USD 80 million, which amounts to ? 560 crore. The LIGO-India project will be built by the Department of Atomic Energy and the Department of Science and Technology, with a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Science Foundation, the US, along with several national and international research and academic institutions. LIGO-India will be an extremely sensitive interferometer of four km arm length capable of sensing gravitational waves generated during the merger of massive astrophysical objects such as black holes, and neutron stars, the statement said. The projects that will be dedicated to the nation include Fission Molybdenum-99 Production Facility, Mumbai; Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Plant, Visakhapatnam; National Hadron Beam Therapy Facility, Navi Mumbai; Radiological Research Unit, Navi Mumbai; Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Visakhapatnam; and Women & Children Cancer Hospital Building, Navi Mumbai, it said. Rare Earth Permanent Magnets production facility has been developed on the campus of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Visakhapatnam. The facility will produce rare earth permanent magnets using indigenous Rare Earth material. India will join a select group of nations with capacity to produce such magnets, that have applications in the manufacture of computer hard disk drives, wind turbine generators and MRI machines. The National Hadron Beam Therapy Facility of Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai works to undertake highly precise delivery of radiation to the tumour with minimal dose to the surrounding normal structures. The precise delivery of dose to target tissue reduces the early and delayed side effects of radiation therapy. Fission Molybdenum-99 Production Facility located in Trombay Campus of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is expected to enable about 9 to 10 lakh patient scans per year, the statement said. The laying of foundation stone and dedication of several cancer hospitals and facilities will decentralise and enhance provisioning of world class cancer care in different regions of the country, it added.This year’s National Technology Day celebrations have a special focus on Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and will showcase live tinkering sessions, engage in tinkering activities, and witness outstanding innovations and products by startups."
PM Modi’s US Visit To Strengthen Commitment For Free Indo-Pacific: White House,https://idrw.org/pm-modis-us-visit-to-strengthen-commitment-for-free-indo-pacific-white-house/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US will show that the partnership between the two nations is people-centric, people-driven, and is good for the world at large, a top Indian diplomat in Washington on Wednesday said, as he called the visit “historic.” “The PM’s forthcoming official state visit to the US, at the invitation of President Biden, is historic. Prime Minister and President Biden have together imparted significantly new vigour and momentum to our bilateral ties,” India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI. “The visit will be an opportunity for the two leaders to spend time together, take stock of the progress achieved and provide guidance on the future limitless possibilities. The visit will also underscore that India-US partnership is people-centric and people-driven, and that it is not just for the two countries, but for the world at large,” Mr Sandhu said. PM Modi’s visit will include a state dinner on June 22, the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had said earlier in the day. “The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defence, clean energy, and space. “The leaders will discuss ways to further expand our educational exchanges and people-to-people ties, as well as our work together to confront common challenges from climate change to workforce development and health security,” Jean-Pierre said. The White House’s announcement on Biden’s invitation to PM Modi has been widely welcomed. “I am delighted that the White House has invited the Prime Minister for a state visit which will help strengthen the strategic partnership between our nations,” Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna told PTI. Khanna is the Co-Chair of the Congressional India Caucus, the largest country-specific caucus in the House of Representatives. Mukesh Aghi, president of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum, said PM Modi’s visit in June will be a wonderful opportunity to elevate the bilateral partnership to the next level. “President Biden and Prime Minister Modi will be meeting in a few weeks’ time at the Quad Leader’s Summit in Australia and later this year at the G20 in India. Both leaders have used minilaterals such as the Quad, I2U2, and the G20 summits to work on common goals,” Mr Aghi told PTI. “However, the state visit will provide a valuable and timely opportunity for both Washington and New Delhi to strengthen the edifice of this strategic partnership and work on enhancing commercial ties, building resilient supply chains, and creating new synergies in the critical and emerging technology domain,” he said. Atul Keshap, president of US India Business Council, said that the invitation is a big diplomatic gesture from the United States. “India was last honoured with a State Visit in 2009. That PM Modi is being honoured with only the third State Visit of the Biden Administration shows the respect and affection the American people have for a rising India,” he said. “It is entirely good and proper that the world’s two greatest democracies further cement their strategic, economic, and technology convergence in these turbulent geostrategic times. “The state visit will remind the world that India and America still have so much more potential to capture in our bilateral relations, reflecting the energy and talent of our demographics and our systems, which serve to empower our free peoples,” Mr Keshap said. Aparna Pande, from the Hudson Institute think-tank, said India is key to the security, diplomatic, and commercial architecture that the United States is building across the Indo Pacific. “For the Modi government also, a stronger strategic partnership with the United States is critical to boosting India’s leverage in the global arena,” Ms Pande said."
South Korea increasingly seeing India as alternative to China: Report,https://idrw.org/south-korea-increasingly-seeing-india-as-alternative-to-china-report/,"May 11, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Strategic ambiguity has been South Korea’s foreign policy formula for more than a decade, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported, adding that this is because Seoul’s decision not to take a side between Washington and Beijing, given its close economic ties with China and the presence of US military forces in the country, was regarded as inevitable. The continued tensions between the US and China, coupled with other external challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, high inflation and the war in Ukraine have further spurred middle-power and export-oriented South Korea to expedite the diversification of its trade and investment portfolio. Amid such circumstances, a series of legislative measures initiated by the Biden administration to deter China’s growth at the expense of relations with its allies has prompted Seoul to accelerate its pivot from Beijing, SCMP reported. Additionally, despite China’s reopening after the pandemic, South Korea’s trade deficit with China in the first quarter of this year amounted to USD 7.8 billion, the first such deficit since the two countries normalised diplomatic relations in 1992 causing Korean businesses to reconsider the importance of maintaining a China focus. Against this backdrop, India has emerged as an attractive destination. Its population is expected to surpass that of China by mid-2023, making it the most populous nation on Earth. What makes India more desirable is not just the size of its population but the size of its young population. Only 7 per cent of the nation is aged 65 or above, compared to China’s 14 per cent and 18 per cent in the US. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that India’s real GDP growth will reach 5.9 per cent this year, 0.7 percentage points higher than that of China, SCMP reported. Another contributing factor is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, which aimed to position the nation as a global manufacturing hub, attract foreign investment and integrate it into global supply chains by offering incentives such as simplified regulatory procedures and tax exemptions. Thanks to this effort, launched in 2014, annual foreign direct investment had doubled to USD 83 billion as of September 2022, according to government figures, the daily reported. Furthermore, the production-linked incentive scheme that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in 2020 has been extended to eligible companies in key sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, cars and more. The scheme offers companies incentives of 4 to 6 per cent on incremental sales over a base year, for five years, to promote a “self-reliant” India. Motivated by such incentives and other factors, major Korean and global companies have relocated or enhanced their manufacturing facilities in India. Samsung, beyond building the world’s largest mobile phone factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, announced in February that it would manufacture its entire Galaxy S23 smartphone series in India instead of importing them from its factory in Vietnam. In January, the company touted the launch of its top-of-the-line fridge range that is “100 per cent made in India, with features made for India”. Another Korean electronics giant, LG, revealed in February it would invest USD 24 million to establish a new manufacturing line at its Pune-based facility, where it will produce premium side-by-side fridges in addition to those at its existing facility in Greater Noida, SCMP reported. Electronics companies are not the only players chasing the India boom. Korean steelmaker POSCO, which abandoned its plan in 2017 to set up a steel project in India, announced last year it would construct a steel mill there, this time with an Indian partner, Adani Group, and an estimated investment of up to USD billion. Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor announced it would acquire General Motors’ plant in Maharashtra to expand its manufacturing in India as part of its commitment to launching six electric vehicle models in the country by 2028. This move is expected to help offset the impact of the company’s withdrawal from Russia amid Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Not surprisingly, the Hyundai Motor factory was one of the main stops for Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin during his visit to India last month to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. He also underlined the contributions of Korean companies to ‘Make in India’. However, there are significant hurdles to foreign investment in India, including deficient infrastructure, an inconsistent regulatory environment and slow bureaucratic processes. A World Bank report last year estimated that USD 840 billion is required to upgrade India’s urban infrastructure in the next 15 years as the country becomes increasingly urbanised, SCMP reported. Meanwhile, the World Bank’s Doing Business 2020 report showed India ranked poorly in several key areas, including 136th in ease of starting a business, 154th in registering property and 163rd in enforcing contracts. Despite the challenges, numerous global businesses are diversifying their supply chains away from China amid growing geopolitical concerns and the ongoing US-China rivalry. Korean companies are no exception, with many exploring the potential of a rising India as a viable option. China’s economic retaliation against South Korea in 2017 for deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system on its soil is a painful reminder for Korean businesses of the risks of overdependence on China, SCMP reported. In response, they are willing to tap into the opportunities India presents. As Modi has said, “The whole world is saying that India’s time has arrived.” With South Korea seeking to reduce its reliance on China, we will see an increase in its investments in India, leveraging shared democratic and market systems, and a special strategic partnership."

Speaking at the Ananta Centre here, he underlined that he would never share details about his discussions with the Indian authorities. “The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a globally respected institution and broadcaster whose news material I consume everyday. Secondly, all organisations have to obey the law of India. BBC is talking to Indian authorities about that,” Ellis said. “Certainly, I would never share all the things that I discussed with the Indian authorities. But good friends can also disagree. I think that it is okay to disagree sometimes,” the British High Commissioner said, making it clear that he was making a general point. In February, BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai were raided by Income Tax officials who claimed to have detected multiple irregularities, including non-payment of tax on certain remittances that were not disclosed as income in India. On the attack on the Indian High Commission in London, Ellis described it a “symptom of extremism” which was a “risk” in any country. “There is no disagreement. What happened at the Indian High commission is not okay. It is a symptom of extremism. Overall extremism is a risk in any country,” he said. The British High Commissioner further said that he completely understood the anger in India over the vandalism at the High Commission and he would be equally agitated if it happened to the British High Commission. Pro-Khalistani protestors tried to vandalise the Indian High Commission in London and pulled down the national flag while holding protests outside the High Commission complex on March 19. It happened a day after the Punjab Police launched a crackdown against radical preacher Amritpal Singh in Punjab. Ellis added that the UK-India relationship is “complex” because of its colonial history and that there will always be “bumps” which were part of the complexity and richness."

CEMILAC Calls for Design Review of ALH-Dhruv,https://idrw.org/cemilac-calls-for-design-review-of-alh-dhruv/,"May 10, 2023","SOURCE: API In response to the third crash of the Dhruv advanced light helicopter in the last three months, the Bengaluru-based Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC), a government regulatory body, has called for a comprehensive design review of a “safety-critical system” on the helicopter. Despite claims from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) that the helicopter has a stable and mature design, a complete audit of the helicopter’s systems, including its safety-critical components, may reveal weaknesses in the aircraft’s design. Such a review may also cast doubt on HAL’s earlier statement that the incident involving the navy ALH on March 8 was due to a technical failure resulting from an error in the assembly of serrated washers in the booster control rods. The recent crashes have raised concerns over the safety of the Dhruv advanced light helicopter, which is widely used by the Indian military and paramilitary forces for a range of operations. In addition to the March 8 incident involving the navy ALH, there have been two other crashes of Dhruv helicopters in the past three months, including one in Arunachal Pradesh in February and another in Tamil Nadu in March. Given the importance of the Dhruv helicopter to India’s military and paramilitary forces, it is imperative that any design flaws or weaknesses are identified and addressed as soon as possible. The design review ordered by CEMILAC is a step in the right direction and will hopefully lead to improvements in the safety and reliability of the helicopter. It remains to be seen, however, whether the audit will confirm or refute HAL’s claims about the cause of the March 8 incident and whether the crash was due to a technical failure or other factors."

US confirms Kyiv used Patriots to down Russian hypersonic missile,https://idrw.org/us-confirms-kyiv-used-patriots-to-down-russian-hypersonic-missile/,"May 10, 2023","SOURCE: ANADOLU AGENCY The Pentagon has confirmed reports that the Ukrainian military used U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to successfully shoot down a Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missile. In a press briefing Tuesday, top Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said: “I can confirm that they did down a Russian missile by employing the Patriot missile defense system. As you know, that system is part of a broader range of air defense capabilities that the United States and the international community have provided to Ukraine.” However, Ryder declined to say which country supplied the missile battery that shot down the hypersonic missile. Patriot air defense systems were used by the U.S. against Iranian ballistic missiles in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, but this marked the first time the system shot down a hypersonic missile. “The U.S., our allies, our partners, we’re going to continue to rush ground-based air defense capabilities and munitions to help Ukraine control its sovereign skies and to help Ukraine defend its citizens from Russian cruise missiles and Iranian drones,” Ryder added. The Biden administration earlier Tuesday pledged $1.2 billion in long-term military assistance to Ukraine, including air defense systems and munitions."

The Akhand Path will be initiated on May 13, followed by the bhog on May 15 in Panjwar village. On May 6, Panjwar was taking a walk in a park in Lahore’s Johar Town when two assailants shot him in the head, killing him. He was cremated at the Babu Sabu crematorium in Lahore the following day, and a granthi from Gurdwara Singh Singhnian and another Sikh activist were allowed to attend the cremation. Sarabjit Singh, Panjwar’s elder brother, has urged the Indian government to help them retrieve the mortal remains of their brother. He said that they had no communication across the border, yet they came to know about their brother’s cremation through some media reports. The family wants to at least bring back his ashes to immerse them as per Sikh rituals during the “antim ardas” on May 15. Several Sikh organisations would also perform prayers at Akal Takht. The Ministry of Home Affairs had declared Panjwar, along with several others, a designated terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in July 2020. He was listed as one of the top 10 most wanted criminals by the Indian government. Panjwar had joined the separatist group KCF in 1986 under the influence of his cousin, Labh Singh, the then KCF chief. The group had claimed responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Shridhar Vaidya, Chief of Army Staff during Operation Blue Star, in Pune on August 10, 1986, and had threatened to target several others. After his cousin’s elimination by Indian security forces, Panjwar took charge of the outfit around 1990 and escaped to Pakistan via the Rajasthan border in 1996. He started living with a fake identity under the patronage of the Pakistani spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and reportedly engaged in raising funds by smuggling weapons, heroin and fake currency notes into India."

Cohen called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and held wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on ways to further expand overall ties. The Israeli foreign minister arrived this morning on a three-day visit but announced his decision to cut short the trip in view of Tel Aviv’s operation against a militant group in the Gaza Strip. The two sides signed an agreement that will allow 42,000 Indian workers to work in the Jewish state in the fields of construction and nursing, an Israeli readout said. In an address at a business forum, Cohen said India, Israel and the Arab countries can together boost regional connectivity and railway networks in the Gulf region and would be carrying Indian shipments to the Israeli port of Haifa in the future. “The trade that will come from India will land at an Arab port and from there can be taken by train to Haifa port,” he said while giving an overview of the shape of future connectivity in the West Asian region. His comments on connectivity in the region came two days after national security advisers of India, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and discussed a major connectivity project. In January, Israel handed over the strategic port of Haifa to the Adani Group. The Port of Haifa is the second largest port in Israel in terms of shipping containers and the biggest in shipping tourist cruise ships. Our vision is that Israel, the Gulf Arab countries and India create the gate of the East to the West, Cohen said. On his meeting with Cohen, Jaishankar, in a tweet, said the two sides initialed an agreement in the area of mobility and described his talks with the Israeli counterpart as “productive”. “The main pillars of our Strategic Partnership – Agriculture, Water, Defence & Security – are taking our ties forward. New agreements in water & agriculture today underline the potential to do more,” he said. “Discussed cooperation in high tech, digital & innovation, as also connectivity, mobility tourism, finance, and health. Noted the progress in I2U2 and cooperation in multilateral forums. Exchanged perspectives on our respective regions, Ukraine and Indo-Pacific,” he added. The I2U2 is a four-nation grouping.

"In A First, Blood Bags Delivered By Drones In Noida",https://idrw.org/in-a-first-blood-bags-delivered-by-drones-in-noida/,"May 10, 2023","SOURCE: ANI A key aspect of drones is that they can be used in healthcare during emergency response not only for providing vaccines and medicines but also for supplying blood bags. The inaugural flight in a validation study carried 10 units of whole blood samples from The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC). This drone sortie was in the visual line of sight conducted at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Dr Rajeev Bahl, DG ICMR said, “This ‘i-DRONE’ was first used during Covid19 pandemic by ICMR for distributing vaccines to unreachable areas. Today, we are transporting blood & blood-related products, which are supposed to be kept at a low temperature. After the experiment, we found that not only can we maintain the temperature, but there was also no damage to the products transported. We sent another sample through an ambulance & if there are no differences in the samples sent using the two modes, then this drone will be used all over India.” The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been a pioneer in using drones for healthcare purposes and successfully conducted the delivery of medical supplies, vaccines, and medicines in remote areas of Manipur and Nagaland. According to Dr Nivedita Gupta, Head, Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases and Scientist, ICMR explained “Challenges in timely delivery of blood and blood products especially in the remote areas and congested metropolitan cities of India were identified. The drone-based delivery of blood may reduce the time for last-mile deliveries within the district.” “Assessing the quality and integrity of fragile bodily fluids such as blood and the impact of drone’s movement is a crucial aspect which requires proper monitoring and validation,” said Dr Sumit Aggarwal. Prof Pammi Gauba, Dean, A&R and Head, Department of Biotechnology, JIIT, emphasised, “This is a pathbreaking validation study involving the collaborative efforts of ICMR, Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC), New Delhi, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida and Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida”. “The protocol development, study designing, implementation, and coordination of the project is being undertaken by Dr Sumit Aggarwal, Dr Kuldeep Nigam, and Dr Nupur Mahajan from ICMR-Headquarters. This ICMR-funded project is being conducted under the guidance of the project principal investigators, Prof Pammi Gauba (JIIT), Prof Anita Nangia and Prof Sangeeta Pahuja from LHMC, Prof Rambha Pathak and Prof Shalini Bahadur from GIMS.

Dr Rajiv Bahl, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research said, “Clarity in challenge mapping and identifying the possible solutions can be achieved by developing indigenous capacities in research, and introduction of innovations and technologies in the mainstream. With digitization, efficient manufacturing of vaccines and the development of a rapid delivery mechanism, India achieved 90pc coverage within a year. The boost of technology is an accelerator which is gradually pushing India towards achieving the status of being a developed nation as envisioned by the Prime Minister.”"
"Chinese militia boats cross ASEAN, Indian warships exercising in South China Sea",https://idrw.org/chinese-militia-boats-cross-asean-indian-warships-exercising-in-south-china-sea/,"May 10, 2023","SOURCE: REUTERS Boats belonging to a Chinese maritime militia approached an area where navies of India and ASEAN countries were taking part in drills in the South China Sea, two Indian sources said on Monday. An independent expert in Vietnam said Beijing appeared to be using the militia to intimidate and disrupt the naval exercise. Beijing has not responded to Reuters queries about the alleged incident and its possible motives. The Indian and Vietnamese governments declined to comment. The two-day sea phase of the ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise (AIME 2023) began on Sunday with naval ships and aircraft from India, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines,Indonesia and Brunei taking part. They were in the Vietnamese Exclusive Economic Zone when the Chinese boats moved towards them, the Indian sources said. However, the militia boats and naval vessels crossed each other without any face-off, they said. Indian authorities were tracking the movements of at least five militia boats, according to the sources, who did not wish to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. A Chinese research vessel was also following these boats towards the same area, they said. Ray Powell, who leads Project Myoushu on the South China Sea at Stanford University, said the boats belong to the Qiong Sansha Yu militia fleet in the area. Such militias consist of commercial fishing boats, which work in coordination with the Chinese authorities for political objectives in the South China Sea. The Chinese government, however, in the past rejected the existence of any such militia. Van Pham, manager of The South China Sea Chronicle Initiative (SCSCI), an independent non-profit which monitors vessel-tracking data, said this was not the first time Chinese “so-called fishing vessels” were around and intimidated warships of other countries. “So it’s likely that the exercise was interrupted…the pattern was broken and some had to change their directions,” she told Reuters. Chinese research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 10 had come as close as 10 miles to the participating Vietnamese warship at one point, Pham said. The drill is the first ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise (AIME-2023) and is co-hosted by the Indian and Singaporean navies. Several of China’s littoral neighbours have accused it of using its official and militia vessels to harass and intimidate their fishing and military boats in the South China Sea. China has for years claimed sovereignty over the entire South China Sea, and has been sensitive to the presence of other militaries in the region. Relations between India and China have also plummeted since a clash between their armies in the Himalayas in 2020 in which 24 soldiers were killed."

Strong vigil being maintained by the forces along the Line of Control and the international border,” defence sources told ANI here. PTI chief Imran Khan was arrested on Tuesday from Islamabad High Court in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case. The main concerns for the Indian side are that the Pakistan Army may try to open up a new front along the LoC by blaming Indian forces or other means to relieve the pressure from internal factors, the sources said. Till evening, the Pakistani troops had not cut down any numbers from forward locations with India but the situation may get clearer tomorrow, they added. India has been on high vigil to stop Pakistani infiltration already but now the situation is tense in Pakistan and there are fears that Pakistan Army may try something drastic to maintain supremacy in Pakistan. PTI chief Imran Khan’s arrest has triggered several violent protests across Pakistan including at the the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi and the residence of the Corps Commander in Lahore, which was once the house of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday afternoon. People have taken to the streets, resorted to violence, arson and even raised many slogans to register their resentment against the arrest of ex-PM of Pakistan and PTI chief Imran Khan, across Pakistan including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Karachi, Quetta, Mardan, Bannu, and Chilas. The protesting mob resorted to stone pelting on houses, offices and vehicles, burning banners and tyres and blocking roads. Several videos surfacing on social media platforms show groups of men, some with their faces covered, entering the gated premises of GHQ with sticks, which they later were seen using to hit the walls. Such violent protests are an aberration in the history of Pakistan, where citizens are seen vandalising the Pak Army GHQ and the residence of the Corps Commander, which has controlled the nation since its independence, showing the growing popularity of Imran Khan. Meanwhile, in Faisalabad, a mob pelted stones on Pakistan Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah’s house. The PTI Chairman was taken into custody while on the grounds of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), where he was there for biometric verification in two cases. Five police officers have been injured in the protests while 43 protesters have been arrested. In the wake of these protests, section-144 has been implemented in Islamabad and in Peshawar. Khan has been detained in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case, according to NAB, which has confirmed the development. According to the report, the NAB head issued the arrest warrants for him on May 1. Earlier, in an exclusive interview with ANI, Tilak Devasher, National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member and a security expert made similar speculations regarding the same, saying that India has to be on guard and should be more watchful after these developments in Pakistan. “We have to be on our guard as in recent cases the majority have shown that people who are there will try and divert attention from what is happening in Pakistan but as far as the army itself is concerned or the government, I think they are going to be very, very busy in the next couple of days,” Tilak Devasher said."
IIT Madras and DRDO to develop Next Generation SONAR,https://idrw.org/iit-madras-and-drdo-to-develop-next-generation-sonar/,"May 10, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) have collaborated to develop a Piezoelectric MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) technology sensor for underwater communications, with potential benefits for defence applications, particularly in the naval forces. According to the Director of DRDO Industry Academia- Ramanujan Centre of Excellence (DIA-RCoE) at IIT Madras, Dr O.R. Nandagopan, this technology has reached a level of maturity that allows for its conversion into a system with the help of Indian industry. He further added that it will be a groundbreaking technology in this field, contributing towards India’s ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ initiative in underwater materials and micro device processing technology. Piezo MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) process technology involves the fabrication of devices that use the piezoelectric effect to sense or generate electrical charges. The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials, such as quartz or ceramics, to produce an electrical charge in response to mechanical stress, or vice versa. In the context of underwater communications and sensing, piezo MEMS technology is used to create high-performance thin films that can be used to build sophisticated and futuristic naval sensors and equipment. These sensors can be used to detect sound waves or vibrations in water, allowing for underwater communication and surveillance. The process of creating piezo MEMS devices involves depositing thin films of piezoelectric material on a substrate, typically using a process such as sputtering or chemical vapour deposition. These thin films can then be patterned and etched to create the desired sensor or device. The most significant challenge in the Piezo MEMS process technology is ensuring excellent dependability and durability in the hostile underwater environment, due to the high pressure and corrosive characteristics of seawater."

The Zircon hypersonic missile can theoretically climb to speeds of Mach 8-9 due to its liquid-fuel scramjet motor. However, the Indian-specific variant of the missile, the BrahMos-2K, will be modified to reach speeds of Mach 6. India will develop a booster stage with solid-fuel engines, along with a winged airframe and an AESA band seeker. However, India is well aware of the high cost of developing hypersonic missiles and wants to limit Russia’s collaboration in the program to the second-stage liquid-fuel scramjet motor. The motor will kick in after the missile reaches supersonic speeds in the first stage, accelerating the missile into the hypersonic flight regime. The BrahMos Aerospace team is currently estimating that the development of Indian-specific systems for the BrahMos-2K variant of the missile will take approximately eight years. Gradual progress is expected in the indigenous system as it enters production later in 2032. This joint development is a significant milestone in the strategic partnership between India and Russia, and it is expected to strengthen India’s military capabilities."
IAF has stood like strong wall for country’s security: Rajnath Singh,https://idrw.org/iaf-has-stood-like-strong-wall-for-countrys-security-rajnath-singh/,"May 10, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday recalled the contribution and role of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in different wars since Independence and said it has stood like a “strong wall” in protection of the nation. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating development projects for Chandigarh, he also said India has always stood for truth, justice and humanity. At a separate event, the defence minister inaugurated the IAF heritage centre. Singh also paid tributes Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch, the late, Parkash Singh Badal. Remembering the valour of air warriors in ensuring victories in different wars, Singh said the IAF has played a very important role in protecting the sovereignty of the country and the nation will always remain indebted to its sacrifices. “The IAF has played a very important role in protecting the sovereignty of our country. Our country, after getting independence, faced many crises, in which our air force stood like a strong wall in the security of the country,” he said. Singh lauded the IAF for its strength and professionalism shown in the 1948 Indo-Pak war, 1961 Goa Liberation War, the 1962 Sino-India was and the 1965 Indo-Pak war. Regarding the India-Pakistan 1971 war, Singh said the jointmanship, integration and commitment showcased by the three services was unprecedented and extraordinary. The 1971 war was not fought for land or power. The main objective behind this war was to protect the dignity of humanity and democracy, the defence minister said. “It proved that India believes in ‘injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere’ and it is our duty to stand against any kind of injustice,” he said. “You are aware that Pakistan, even long after independence, could not proceed through the democratic process towards general elections. If there was something in the name of governance, it was ‘martial law’ and sometimes it was ’emergency rule’,” Singh said. When the general elections were held for the first time in 1970 in Pakistan, instead of giving an opportunity to the winning outfit, they were sent to jail, he said. “Not only sent them to jail, but also common and innocent citizens who were demanding human rights were massacred on a large scale during this period,” Singh said. In such a situation, to liberate people there from such a cruel regime was “our country’s ‘raj dharam’, ‘rashtra dharam’ and ‘sainya dharam’”, he said. Winning the war on the strength of strategies and not imposing any kind of political control there symbolised India’s strengths as well as its values and cultural generosity, Singh said. Singh said India, which considers the whole earth as its family, will always be proud of the fact that it has always stood on the side of truth, justice and humanity whenever the need arose. “This was also the basis of the 1971 war. The achievements and learnings of this war guided us in future conflicts as well,” the defence minister said citing the victory in the 1999 Kargil war. While speaking about cyber frauds, Singh said anti-national elements have such weapons which one cannot spot and these have the capability to cause big damage. He said a centre for cyber operation and security has been established here and added that neighbouring states and their police force can take advantage of this to solve cases. It will help strengthen cyber security, Singh said. The defence minister also inaugurated a ‘gaushala’ (cow shelter) here and said “the cow is an important centre of faith of people in Indian society”. “Many a times, it is seen that cows are left as strays. Many times it is seen that cows are wandering here and there. I feel that this is a symbol of the ungratefulness of human society. We should ponder over this. To ensure they are looked after is important,” Singh said. Singh also laid the foundation stone of a hostel block at a government college and extension of a boys hostel in the Punjab Engineering College."

The Israeli army began hitting targets in the Strip just after 2 am in what appeared to be a coordinated surprise attack on the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement’s senior leaders. Prior to the operation, Israeli residents of areas within 40 kilometres (25 miles) of Gaza were instructed to enter or stay near bomb shelters amid fears of retaliatory attacks, as raids continued to thunder across the Strip. According to The Times of Israel, previous strikes on Islamic Jihad leaders sparked barrages of rockets on Israeli civilians and intense battles with Israeli troops, some lasting several days. At least 12 people including the three senior members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement were killed in the latest air raids on Gaza Strip by Israel’s military on Tuesday. His visit came after Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat travelled to India this year in April with a large business delegation on a four-day official visit aiming to strengthen bilateral ties in common areas of interest, automotive technologies, and fintech."

In an exclusive interview with ANI, Devasher said, “This time Rangers were used. It’s an important development in Pakistan. There will be an outcry in Pakistan because of his popularity and his supporters in all provinces. If people will start protesting, and if there is violence then it will lead to a law and order problem. Khan was arrested by Rangers personnel from Islamabad High Court (IHC) — acting on National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) warrant. The PTI chairman was arrested as part of NAB’s investigation in the Al-Qadir Trust case ahead of his appearance before the IHC to seek bail in multiple FIRs registered against him. Terming the arrest as an important development in Pakistan, the NSAB member said, “This is something that has been waiting to happen for a considerable amount of time. You recall a month or two ago, the police tried to arrest him from Zaman Park even though they had an arrest warrant. But his supporters didn’t allow the police to enter and then the police backed off.” “I think, in Pakistan what happens in the next week or next few days or next week are going to determine what happens in Pakistan in the next couple of months at least,” he added. Responding to another question on how he sees the political future of Imran Khan, as well as the PTI party, the defence expert said, “You see, now it all depends. He has been arrested, now the case is going on. Does he get relief in the case? Is the case dismissed? Will they use this to disqualify him from contesting elections?” “If that happens, then it’s a major dent for the PTI, because what is PTI without Imran Khan? Without Imran Khan, the party will not be able to do well whenever, as and when the elections are held. So this is a major, major development. We’ll have to wait and watch how this case actually progresses. Does he get bail and is he then disqualified by the election commission as a result of this arrest?” He also explained that the Rangers did so in an effort to quickly take him away, so as to avoid his supporters’ chaos. “But whether it was actually so or not if the Rangers had an arrest warrant duly issued by a court, then he is just picked up. And I think the Ranger’s effort was to whisk him away before the crowds gather quickly and before they prevent him from being taken away. So I don’t think that is as important as the fact that he has been arrested. That in any case will lead to outrage and an outcry all over Pakistan,” the defence expert added. Throwing light on the possible scenarios in Pakistan and what will set the court or what will happen in Pakistan, he said, “If the people come out in the streets, start protesting, and if there is violence, if there is arson, and when the public is charged, you don’t know what will happen. So if that kind of situation happens, then it will lead to massive law and order problems in different places. And then the government, then the army is also watching they will have to take a call and how do they settle and get a grip.” “So I think it is now early, just about an hour ago that he was arrested. I think we will have to see how the crowd develops and the real test of his popularity will come, as how do crowds react to his arrest.” Meanwhile, there is massive outrage across Pakistan and PTI supporters are protesting against Imran Khan’s arrest. PTI workers held protests in cities across the country, including Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan, Peshawar, and Mardan, reported Geo News. In Karachi, demonstrators clashed with the police near Nursery. They threw stones at police vehicles and tore down street lights. There were reports that police fired teargas shells at the protesters. Police also fired teargas shells at protesters on Rawalpindi’s Murree Road. The PTI supporters are seen chanting “Release Imran Khan,” and “Shut down Pakistan,” in the streets of Lahore, Faizabad, Bannu, and Peshawar. People of Lahore moving from Liberty towards Lahore Cantt,” tweeted PTI’s handle. Imran Khan’s party Twitter handle urged Pakistanis to come out and protest against his arrest. “Pakistan, it’s your time now. It’s now or never an opportunity. People must come out to defend their country now,” it tweeted. “It’s your time, people of Pakistan. Khan has always stood for you, now it’s time to stand for him. #ReleaseImranKhan,” it added. Answering a question, of whether India should be more watchful after these developments in Pakistan, the defence expert said that India has to be on guard. “Yes, we have to be on our guard as in recent cases the majority have shown that people who are there will try and divert attention from what is happening in Pakistan but as far as the army itself is concerned or the government, I think they are going to be very, very busy in the next couple of days,” Tilak Devasher said."

This contradicts the Pakistani narrative that the JF-17 is a cheaper alternative to other fighter jets, such as the Tejas Mk1A, which has an estimated cost of around $42 million per aircraft. Air Commodore (retd) Jamal Hussein suggests that the JF-17 is a capable air defence fighter and suitable for countries that are short on cash.

Regarding the JF-17 Block 3’s armament, Hussein claims that it can be armed with the PL-15 missile, which has a longer range than the US-made AMRAAM and French MICA missiles.

Although there is little information available, it appears that the award entails preparing an existing customer country to receive its initial F-35s.

The recent contract awarded to Lockheed Martin by the US Department of Defense (DoD) for “support of an undisclosed country’s integration as a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customer into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program” appears to involve the preparation of an existing customer to receive their first F-35s. Since the term “integration” typically refers to activities that happen before the delivery of aircraft, it is probable that the customer is among the buyers who have yet to field the F-35s. Therefore, Belgium and Finland are the most likely countries that could be behind this undisclosed integration contract."

The proposed 3,000-km railway, connecting Pakistan’s port of Gwadar to Kashgar in China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), was assessed by scientists from the state-owned China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group Co Ltd. India has protested to China over the USD 60 billion CPEC corridor as it is being laid through PoK. China’s increasing number of projects in Pakistan with billions of dollars in loans raised concerns about the increasing indebtedness of Pakistan, which is reeling under a serious economic crisis. The CPEC is officially regarded as the flagship project of China’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – the pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Institute Group Co Ltd team, led by its deputy director of capital operations Zhang Ling, said in its study that if the project is taken up, it will be BRI’s most expensive transport infrastructure, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. Despite the cost, the project had the potential to reshape trade and geopolitics across the Eurasian continent and should be supported, the research team said in a report published by the Chinese-language journal Railway Transport and Economy in April. The Post quoted the report as saying that “the government and financial institutions [in China] should provide strong support, increase coordination and collaboration among relevant domestic departments, strive for the injection of support funds and provide strong policy support and guarantees for the construction of this project.” The institute is one of the largest of its kind in China and has been involved in many major railway projects at home and internationally, including Indonesia’s Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail line. The proposed railway will link China’s western regions with the Arabian Sea, bypassing the Strait of Malacca and reducing dependence on the South China Sea, it said, highlighting its strategic importance. The recommendation for the CPEC railway line with such high costs is significant as China earlier spoke of plans to build an oil pipeline through the mountainous region which raised questions about the feasibility and costs of pumping oil through the great heights. The feasibility paper argued that connecting the railway with other transport networks in the region including in Iran and Turkey would also provide a more direct route to Europe for Chinese goods, while it could improve Pakistan’s infrastructure. The study report also pointed out the railway’s potential impact on neighbouring countries, such as India and there could be disagreements or delays in decision-making related to the project. It cautioned that China may have to take the entire expenditure unlike its other trans-nation projects considering Pakistan’s current economic crisis. It also pointed out that Pakistan had experienced security challenges in recent years, including in its western region where the railway will pass through. Balochistan province, for instance, where Gwadar port is located has been plagued by separatist violence for decades, the latest being two explosions at Pakistan’s counterterrorism office in which 13 people were killed, the Post reported. This could potentially disrupt the construction and operation of the railway and pose a risk to Chinese workers and investments, it said. Besides the CPEC railway, China is also carrying out a feasibility study to build a trans-Himalayan railway to connect Nepal through Tibet."
IAF working on phasing out remaining three squadrons of MiG-21 jets,https://idrw.org/iaf-working-on-phasing-out-remaining-three-squadrons-of-mig-21-jets/,"May 9, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The crash of a MiG-21 jet in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh on Monday has once again put the spotlight on the Indian Air Force’s aging fleet of Soviet-origin aircraft which have been involved in around 400 accidents since their first induction in the early 1960s. Three people were killed after the MiG-21 fighter aircraft crashed into a house in Hanumangarh in Rajasthan shortly after it took off for a routine training sortie from the Air Force Station at Suratgarh. The MiG-21s used to be the mainstay of the IAF for a long period of time. After its induction in the early 1960s, the Indian Air Force procured over 870 MiG-21 fighters to boost its overall combat prowess. However, the aircraft has a very poor safety record. According to official data, the MiG-21s were involved in 400 crashes in the last six decades. At present, the IAF has three MiG-21 squadrons with a total of around 50 aircraft, according to officials. The IAF last year finalised a timeline of three years to phase out the remaining Mig-21 fighter squadrons. The IAF also plans to start the phasing out of the three squadrons of Mig-29 fighter jets in the next five years, they said. The plan to phase out the Soviet-origin aircraft fleet is part of the IAF’s modernisation drive. “The MiG-21 phase-out plan is on track,” said a military official. The official said the phase-out plan is not linked to the recent accidents involving the platforms. As part of the IAF’s modernisation plan, the defence ministry in February 2021, sealed a Rs 48,000 crore deal with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the procurement of 83 Tejas jets. The IAF has already procured 36 Rafale jets to enhance its combat capabilities. The IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Medium Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA). In March last year, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhat said in Rajya Sabha that 42 defence personnel were killed in accidents involving aircraft and helicopters of the three services in the last five years. The total number of air accidents in the last five years was 45 out of which 29 involved IAF’s platforms, according to official data. Two pilots of the IAF were killed in July last year when their twin-seater Mig-21 trainer aircraft crashed during a training sortie near Barmer in Rajasthan. An ALH Dhruv crashed on Thursday following a “hard landing” in Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir. In a rare accident in January, a Russian-designed Sukhoi-30MKI jet and a French Mirage-2000 had a mid-air collision. In October last year, a weapon system integrated version of an Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) of the Indian Army crashed near Tuting in Arunachal Pradesh. Another ALH-WSI had crashed into the massive Ranjit Sagar reservoir near Pathankot on August 3, 2021 in which two Army pilots were killed. Between March 2017 to December 2021, 31 people lost their lives in accidents involving 15 military helicopters that included four ALH, four Cheetah, two ALH (WSI), three Mi-17V5, an Mi-17 and a Chetak, according to official details. In December 2021, Gen Bipin Rawat, India’s first Chief of Defence Staff, his wife Madhulika and 11 other armed forces personnel died when an Mi-17VH helicopter crashed near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu."

Two of them were from Himachal Pradesh. He paid tributes to these soldiers for their martyrdom and expressed sympathy to their families. Shanta Kumar said terrorism in Kashmir is not taking the name of stopping. He said that not hundreds, but thousands of army personnel and other civilians have been martyred. He said this is not terrorism in Kashmir it is Pakistan waging a hidden war (proxy war) in Kashmir by its army. Former Chief minister said that because Pakistan cannot come forward and fight with India as Pakistan has lost badly in every war. Former Union Minister said India should also change its strategy to fight this war by the army. He demanded that the entire Kashmir should be completely handed over to the army and they should be given full freedom to wipe out this terrorism completely. He further said that the local people who help terrorists should be caught and sent to jail in places like Divrugarh away from Kashmir. He said only the army can compete with the army. He said the martyrdom of Arvind Kumar of Daroh has emotionally made him disturbed his heart has trembled.

Will “Re-Accelerate” Work With India: Israel Foreign Minister,https://idrw.org/will-re-accelerate-work-with-india-israel-foreign-minister/,"May 9, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Expressing “great satisfaction” at the achievements of 30 years of full diplomatic ties between India and Israel, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen has said that it is time for the two nations to “re-accelerate” their relations in various fields to strengthen the strategic partnership. Just ahead of his three-day visit starting on Tuesday, Cohen told PTI that the visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel in 2017 and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu to India in 2018 helped bring the bilateral relations to “new heights of cooperation, understanding and even deepened the friendship not only between the governments but also between the peoples”. “We expect that Prime Minister Netanyahu’s visit to India later this year will continue the momentum in relations both in the areas in which I will be engaged during my visit and in other areas”, he said. India and Israel have seen an intense last few months of engagement starting with the visit of Knesset’s (Israeli parliament) Speaker Amir Ohana at the end of March followed by the visit of Minister of Economy Nir Barkat in April and now comes the visit of the Israeli Foreign Minister in quick succession. The visits are being seen as a build-up to the much-anticipated visit of Netanyahu towards the end of this year. “Indeed, we are at a stage where we are re-accelerating relations between the two countries after certain delays during the COVID period. Last year we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. We are greatly satisfied with our great achievements during this period and now is the time to look forward and strengthen the strategic relations between the countries,” Cohen said. This visit is an opportunity to promote economic and cultural issues and even inaugurate the Jewish path in Mumbai, he listed as the main issues on the agenda of his visit. The Jewish Path, or the “Jewish Trail”, is an initiative under which important Jewish monuments in Mumbai have been identified and will be opened to tourists around the world. Jewish people have been living in Maharashtra for more than two thousand years and have always taken pride in the lack of anti-semitism in India. Looking to utilise both the countries’ proven track record as knowledge economies with robust start-ups ecosystem, special emphasis in discussions will be given to the field of innovation with an emphasis on water management, agriculture, health, climate, and education. “Agreements are expected to be signed in the field of water technologies and the centers of excellence that Israel operates together with the Indian authorities”, the Israeli Foreign Minister noted. “The potential for growth in the field of innovation between Israel and India is immense,” he said. “Further, there is a great potential for cooperation on cleantech technologies and renewable energy on a bilateral level as well as multilateral forums like the I2U2,” Cohen emphasised. Israel has played an important role in India’s agricultural sector by opening Centers of Excellence and has recently appointed a dedicated water attach&#233; at its mission in Delhi realising the huge potential for collaboration in these fields. Beyond bilateral cooperation, the two countries have also been working with the United Arab Emirates and the United States in a grouping termed I2U2, looking to harness the partner members’ strength to promote their global footprint together. Cohen said that “India has a significant contribution to this important platform that supports peace and stability in the region”. The I2U2 was launched during Foreign Minister S Jaishankar’s visit to Israel in October 2021 when the foreign ministers of the four countries laid down the basic principles of taking this alliance forward with the Foreign Ministers of UAE and the US participating virtually. “The I2U2 is a central platform for regional and international cooperation. We believe that the shared knowledge of Israel and India in the fields of food security, water management and treatment in space, and of course agriculture, can allow many I2U2 projects to get underway,” Cohen believes. He pointed out that “Israel recently proposed cooperation in a new satellite project that utilises all four strengths of the partner countries” and is excited to “imagine what the future holds in this regard”. “The connection between Israel, India and the United Arab Emirates connects Asia and Europe and creates opportunities to strengthen the relationship between Israel and India. It brings significant achievements for all the partners’ economies”, Cohen asserted. Acknowledging India’s fast-growing economy making it the fifth largest economy in the world, the Israeli leader said that forecasts predict that it will climb to the third spot and so Israel attaches great importance to the economic ties between the two countries. Asked about the long pending Free Trade Agreement between the two countries, he said that it will be brought up for discussions during his visit and that there is a “strong desire to finalise it”. “The scope for trade opportunities between our countries is huge and there is a strong desire to finalise an FTA that hopefully will further strengthen our economic ties. I am intending to raise this topic during my high-level meetings, as I believe the scope of the FTA is far larger than trade numbers. We should discuss it with the vision of Bilateral relations in mind”, he stressed. From a humble beginning of USD 200 million in bilateral trade (primarily in diamonds) in 1992 when full diplomatic relations were established between the two countries, merchandise trade has diversified and reached USD 7.86 billion (excluding defenCe) during the period 2021-2022. In addition, bilateral trade in services in 2021 was USD 1.1 billion and in FY 2022-23 bilateral merchandise trade from April to December 2022 stood at USD 8.09 billion (excluding defence). With air traffic between the two countries getting a boost with the Gulf countries agreeing to open their airspace to Israeli airlines, Cohen described it as a “game changer” which also brings out India’s importance in the region. “Although the Corona epidemic temporarily reduced the number of direct flights, now we are talking about increasing the number of flights and increasing the destinations,” Cohen noted. “This clearly symbolises the importance of India in the context of the Abraham Accords and the relevance of India to strengthening the atmosphere of regional cooperation,” he pointed out. “The launch of more direct flights will increase the connectivity between our nations to facilitate the movement of tourists, business people and students. This boost to regional connectivity has also benefited the people of India. The thriving Indian community throughout the Gulf can now fly directly from the UAE to Israel or from Israel to Bahrain,” the minister said. He also highlighted the immense impact it has on boosting trade relations in the region. Cohen also intends to bring in more students from India to Israel as academic cooperation between the two countries has “inexhaustible potential”. “We need to make a greater effort to be attractive to a larger number of Indian students. Professional officials are examining the issue with the universities and the Council for Higher Education. We are very interested in a large number of foreign students coming to Israel, and certainly students from India. This will bring the scientific communities of the two countries closer together in the long term”, he said. Asked as to how India’s Presidency of G20 and an invite for New Delhi to the G-7 summit can be helpful in strengthening Indo-Israel ties, he said, “We are confident that the agenda that India promotes in these forums is for the benefit of the global economy, of which Israel is a part”. “The frequent consultations between various parties in Israel and India touch on many areas, but in issues of the G20 and G7 India has a unique role also due to its size and economic strength and its international importance”, he asserted. On India’s role in the Middle East, the Israeli foreign minister said: “Regarding India’s role in the MEA (Middle East Area), we see a growing involvement of India in many places in the world, including in the MEA, including getting closer to the United Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and more. This is definitely a positive process because, as mentioned, India has a positive influence on the atmosphere of cooperation in the region.” On the question of defence ties and Israel’s participation in the flagship Make in India programme, Cohen said that the defence ties have been “a key pillar of the growing partnership between the two nations”. “Our relations are based on three basic foundations: shared values, mutual interests and common challenges. With such well-synchronised defence cooperation, Israel was among the first countries to take up the call for the ‘Make in India’ initiative and start joint projects with a manufacturing base in India”, the Israeli FM emphasised. “We have no doubt in Israel, that R&D serves as a growth engine for the local industry. That is why we are willing to create more platforms of joint R&D to pinpoint shared challenges, discuss and find solutions together, and even manufacture them together. Both sides have a lot to gain from this collaboration,” he added."

Moreover, one more squadron is planned to be phased out later this year. Presently, IAF operates only three Mig-21Bis squadrons that are deployed at forward airbases in the western sector. The delivery of domestically manufactured Tejas Mk1A fighter jets is expected to commence next year, and it is hoped that they will replace the Mig-21 fleet. The IAF currently operates two squadrons of Tejas Mk1 in the southern part of India and has used them in multiple air exercises to develop tactics around the jet. The initial plan was to move the first squadron from the south to the north-western sector after completing squadron levels. However, this has not been feasible for unforeseen reasons. IAF is now relying on the first squadron of Tejas Mk1A, to be deployed at the forward airbase from 2025 onwards, to fill the void left by the Mig-21 fleet. Despite the challenges posed by the ageing fleet, the IAF has been working hard to upgrade its capabilities. The induction of modern fighter jets like the Rafale, along with the domestic production of Tejas Mk1A, will significantly enhance the IAF’s capabilities. With the deployment of Tejas Mk1A squadrons at forward airbases, IAF’s combat readiness will be further strengthened, and it will be better equipped to handle any future security challenges."
"Eye on 6th gen, Clean sheet Engine program only way for AMCA",https://idrw.org/eye-on-6th-gen-clean-sheet-engine-program-only-way-for-amca/,"May 9, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Sources familiar with the matter have informed idrw that the current generation engines being offered to India cannot be upgraded later to incorporate into a 6th generation program. Short-sightedness in this regard may lead India to a similar import-dependence situation as the lack of funding for the Kaveri program did. According to an eminent scientist who wished to remain anonymous, 6th generation fighter jets will require Variable Cycle Engines (VCE), and India will be left with engine technology that was designed 30 years ago for a jet that will be released in 10 years and will soon become obsolete. The Kaveri program was supposed to establish a high-tech ecosystem for the development of more complex engines with higher thrust levels, but the lack of strategic vision has left the country without a fully functional wind tunnel facility or high-altitude flight test facility to test its engines, even after 30 years of the program. Scientists have expressed concern that the absence of such a facility means that an indigenously designed engine has to be transported to Russia or other countries, making the process time-consuming. These facilities were promised when the Kaveri program was initiated three decades ago. The development of a clean sheet engine program is projected to cost more than $5 billion, and when coupled with the construction of a ground support testing facility, the expense could surpass $7 billion. India is planning to procure thousands of engines for 500 indigenous jet engines over the next 20 years, while it also needs to simultaneously keep an eye on variable cycle engines for future aircraft beyond the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). The variable cycle engine is designed to allocate energy distribution among various airflow paths to meet the performance requirements of the power system for complex flight tasks. It is widely acknowledged that the only way to fulfil the advanced performance requirements of “sixth-generation” combat aircraft, without altering the laws of physics, is to adopt VCE technology. Although the United States demonstrated 5th-generation fighter jet technology nearly 25 years ago, India is still striving to catch up. Meanwhile, 6th-generation programs are already gaining momentum, with the United States having a head start. However, within the next 10-12 years, 3-4 countries are expected to join the elite 6th generation club, in contrast to the 20 years that China and Russia took to reach 5th generation technology."

Bayraktar TB2 by Türkiye becomes most sold UCAV,https://idrw.org/bayraktar-tb2-by-turkiye-becomes-most-sold-ucav/,"May 9, 2023","SOURCE: API Turkey has emerged as a major player in the global unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) market, thanks to the success of its flagship drone, the Bayraktar TB2. According to recent reports, Turkey has exported this drone to the largest number of countries, surpassing other leading UCAV exporters like the U.S. and China. The Bayraktar TB2 has gained popularity among militaries around the world due to its advanced technology and proven track record in various operations. Since its induction in 2014, the Bayraktar TB2 has been exported to 29 countries, with more than 400 units sold to these nations. This impressive feat has solidified Turkey’s position as a leader in the UCAV export market. The drone’s success can be attributed to its advanced capabilities, including long-endurance flights, real-time video and data transmission, and the ability to carry out precision strikes with its laser-guided missiles. It is worth noting that while China’s Wing Loong I and II UCAV family has been a popular choice among 12 countries, it has faced some challenges in the global market. Despite being the third-largest exporter of UCAVs, China’s UCAV sales have reportedly been impacted by issues such as poor build quality and a lack of proper after-sales support. In recent years, some African countries have been among the main buyers of Chinese-made UCAVs, partly due to the lower costs and often attractive financing deals offered by China. However, some of these countries have also expressed concerns about the quality and reliability of the equipment they have received. As a result, China’s position in the UCAV market may be somewhat unstable, and it may face increased competition from other UCAV manufacturers. The U.S. and China are also major players in the UCAV market, with the former exporting the MQ-9 Reaper and the latter exporting the Wing Loong series. However, Turkey’s success in the market can be attributed to its strategic partnerships and alliances with countries that have been seeking to enhance their military capabilities in recent years. The Bayraktar TB2 has been used in various conflicts around the world, including in Syria, Iraq, and Azerbaijan, where it has demonstrated its effectiveness in combat operations. As the global demand for unmanned aerial vehicles continues to rise, it is expected that competition among UCAV manufacturers and exporters will intensify. However, with its proven track record and advanced capabilities, Turkey’s Bayraktar TB2 is likely to continue to dominate the UCAV export market in the years to come."

The company aims to complete at least four launches in 2024, taking advantage of the country’s new embrace of space startups. “This opens up India as a gateway for private players to go into space,” says Srinath Ravichandran, Agnikul’s co-founder. Agnikul has no intention of taking on heavyweights such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is working on spacecraft that can carry as much cargo as a half-dozen eighteen-wheelers can. Instead the company says its Agnibaan rocket can serve customers seeking to launch payloads of 100 kilograms (220 pounds). And with the number of satellites in orbit projected to grow tenfold, to more than 60,000, by 2030, Ravichandran says private companies such as his can prosper by catering to price-conscious customers. “There is enough stuff for everyone to do,” he says. Promoting India’s space sector is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s strategy of offering an alternative to China for goods ranging from auto parts to iPhones. As in many other industries, India’s space startups got a late start compared with their Chinese peers, which have been allowed in the field for almost a decade and have completed several orbital launches. India didn’t start liberalizing the sector until 2020. Many Indians say Russia’s isolation following last year’s invasion of Ukraine, coupled with growing tensions between China and the US, makes their country an increasingly attractive option for Western companies looking for space products or services. And India’s standing will be bolstered by its decades of providing tech outsourcing services at relatively low cost, says Anil Kumar Bhatt, director general of the Indian Space Association, an industry lobbying group. “The credibility the Indian IT industry enjoys will be passed on to space,” he says. Pixxel, a startup in Bengaluru, in February released the first vivid pictures from what’s planned to be a network of 24 satellites capable of taking high-resolution images for use in agriculture, mining and oil exploration. And in November, Skyroot Aerospace launched India’s first privately developed rocket. “India has the opportunity to narrow the gap with China in the global space business as it is in a better position politically,” says Skyroot Chief Executive Officer Pawan Kumar Chandana. India’s space companies have gotten backing from the likes of Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Silicon Valley-based Sherpalo Ventures. The government is preparing rules to make foreign investment in space projects easier, and in April it unveiled policies aimed at encouraging private-sector participation across the industry. “For Modi, this is like a linchpin of his entire progressive India campaign,” says Sheetal Bahl, a partner with GrowX Ventures, a VC firm in Delhi that’s invested in Pixxel and Bellatrix Aerospace, a Bengaluru startup that develops spacecraft and propulsion systems. “He wants us to be positioned as a leader in space tech.” India has a long way to go before it can match China. As of 2020, India accounted for just 2.3% of all Earth-orbiting satellites, compared with 13.6% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Indian space startups have attracted investments totaling $220 million from venture capitalists since 2011, according to the Indian Space Association. Chinese companies received almost five times that much last year alone. And India’s technological capabilities remain far behind China’s, says Sunil Indurti, director of Azista BST Aerospace, a venture between a German design firm and an Indian manufacturer that says it can make some 50 satellites a year. The joint venture, which plans to launch its first remote-sensing satellite aboard a SpaceX rocket in June, can produce its spacecraft for 20% less than rivals elsewhere, according to Indurti. But he says there’s still much India’s industry must learn to be truly competitive. “We can’t leapfrog the entire curve in just a couple of years,” he says. Industry executives are counting on the Indian Space Research Organization, a state-controlled agency, to help accelerate that process. ISRO has more than five decades of experience, and in 2014 it sent an orbiter to Mars. NewSpace India Ltd., the agency’s commercial arm, in March launched three dozen satellites into low-Earth orbit for OneWeb Ltd., a London company competing with SpaceX to deploy communication satellites. Pixxel CEO Awais Ahmed says his company and its rivals in the growing sector will benefit from the agency’s support and from the facilities it’s built at Sriharikota. “There are probably five or six countries in the world that have that kind of infrastructure and expertise to bank on,” he says. “And India is one of those.”"
“Quad not a military alliance”: Australian High Commissioner to India,https://idrw.org/quad-not-a-military-alliance-australian-high-commissioner-to-india/,"May 9, 2023","SOURCE: ANI The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is not a military alliance but a diplomatic relationship that has come together post the Tsunami, which has shaped a vision for the Indo-Pacific and that’s empowering, Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell said on Monday. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Farrell said, “The Quad is not a military alliance. It has no intention of being a military alliance. It is a diplomatic relationship that has come together post that tsunami that created incredible devastation and loss of lives and has progressively shaped a vision for the Indo-Pacific that’s empowering that is about giving people opportunities to do the things they want to do in life to the best of their ability.” “And the Quad knows that if countries can’t make sovereign choices, citizens can’t make sovereign choices. India and Australia know that countries can’t have proper choices without strong economic growth. And that’s one of the reasons too, that on the bilateral front, Australia and India are doing more economically. So whichever way you look at it, the quad’s been positive. I think it should be celebrated in Sydney on the 24 May, but equally continue to apply itself to its task across the Indo-Pacific and to engage all those countries who are prepared to share the vision and understand that we’ve got to operate within the rules,” he added. The Quad is the grouping of four democracies — India, Australia, the US, and Japan — that aims to ensure and support a “free, open and prosperous” Indo-Pacific region. Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that it will host the Quad Leaders’ Summit on May 24 in Sydney reiterating that it will be a chance to work in cooperation with US, Japan and India. On the upcoming Quad summit, the Australian High Commissioner to India said PM Albanese is looking forward to the upcoming summit as it is another great opportunity to showcase Sydney to the world. He also stated that this is an interesting year for all 4 Quad partners. India is hosting G20, Japan to host the G7, Australia is hosting the Quad and US is hosting Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. So, Quad partners are cooperating multilaterally to shape a better world for us all. “We share a positive agenda for a secure, safe and sovereign Indo-Pacific that abides by the rules. And we’ve seen whether in areas of energy, health, security, infrastructure or connectivity, practical outcomes from Quad meetings that have helped countries make choices for themselves,” Farrell said. Over China’s aggressive stance in the Indo-Pacific, he stated that the agenda and the vision Quad has of an open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific, where countries and citizens are able to make choices according to their national and personal interests is one that most countries will sign up to. He believed what the Quad’s delivering is a better future for all people that live across the Indo-Pacific. That’s what they’re trying to achieve, and that’s what this meeting will continue to progress, he noted."

Devasher made the above remarks in an exclusive interview with ANI hours after Imran Khan was arrested in Pakistan from outside Islamabad High Court by Rangers on the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) warrant in the Al-Qadir Trust case. “I think, in Pakistan what happens in the next week or next few days or next week are going to determine what happens in Pakistan in the next couple of months at least,” he added. The NSAB member also termed Khan’s arrest an important development in Pakistan, and said, “This is something that has been waiting to happen for a considerable amount of time. You recall a month or two ago, the police tried to arrest him from Zaman Park even though they had an arrest warrant. But his supporters didn’t allow the police to enter and then the police backed off.” Responding to another question on how he sees the political future of Imran Khan, as well as the PTI party, the defence expert said, “You see, now it all depends. He has been arrested, now the case is going on. Does he get relief in the case? Is the case dismissed? Will they use this to disqualify him from contesting elections?” “If that happens, then it’s a major dent for the PTI, because what is PTI without Imran Khan? Without Imran Khan, the party will not be able to do well whenever, as and when the elections are held. So this is a major, major development. We’ll have to wait and watch how this case actually progresses. Does he get bail and is he then disqualified by the election commission as a result of this arrest?” Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday termed Imran Khan’s arrest as “legal,” reported Geo News. When asked if there will be massive outrage across Pakistan, given the PTI claims of Rangers abducting Imran Khan, Devasher said, “You see, irrespective of how he was arrested, there will be an outcry in Pakistan because of his popularity, because of his supporters in all the provinces, there will be now it will be in the PTI’s interest to say that he was abducted, he was roughed up. ” He also explained that the Rangers did so in an effort to quickly take him away, so as to avoid his supporters’ chaos. “But whether it was actually so or not if the Rangers had an arrest warrant duly issued by a court, then he is just picked up. And I think the Rangers effort was to quickly whisk him away before the crowds gather and before they prevent him from being taken away. So I don’t think that is so important as the fact that he has been arrested. That in any case will lead to outrage and an outcry all over Pakistan,” the defence expert added. Imran Khan was arrested on Tuesday afternoon from outside the IHC by a group of Ranger personnel. Khan’s arrest has been termed a fascist action by PTI and the party has also called its supporters to come out on the streets in maximum numbers to register their anger over the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan."
China seeks ‘new fields’ of cooperation with Pakistan military,https://idrw.org/china-seeks-new-fields-of-cooperation-with-pakistan-military/,"May 9, 2023","SOURCE: REUTERS China’s defence minister on Monday told Pakistan’s navy chief that their militaries including their navies should “expand into new fields of cooperation” to bolster the capability of the two neighbours in safeguarding security in the region. Ties between the two militaries stretch back years, with their navies and air forces holding bilateral exercises in each other’s territory. For China, Pakistan and its access to the Arabian Sea is key in the event of a maritime blockade in the Strait of Malacca. But Chinese interest in the region has stirred concern, especially in neighbouring India after China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti on the northwestern fringe of the Indian Ocean in 2017. China’s Defence Minister Li Shangfu told Pakistan’s Chief of Naval Staff Amjad Khan Niazi, who was visiting Beijing, that the two countries’ military relationship was a key part of bilateral ties. “The two militaries should expand into new areas of exchanges, create new high points of cooperation to continuously enhance their ability to deal with all sorts of risks and challenges, and jointly maintain the security interests of the two countries and of the region,” said Li, according to a statement on China’s Ministry of National Defense website. Niazi’s visit comes after Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, said in late April that the Chinese military was willing to deepen and expand cooperation with Pakistan’s military. So far, China has not disclosed if it had sought military access to Pakistan’s Chinese-funded, deepwater port of Gwadar. The Pentagon previously identified Pakistan as a possible location for a future Chinese military base, with Gwadar seen as the likely location. Any sign of that happening would fuel New Delhi’s worries of growing Chinese military alliances and assets in its own backyard. In 2022, New Delhi expressed concern over a Chinese survey ship’s visit to a strategic port in Sri Lanka. In 2014, Sri Lanka angered India when a Chinese submarine and a warship were allowed to dock in Colombo."

"After J&K, India finds Lithium reserves in Nagaur, Rajasthan",https://idrw.org/after-jk-india-finds-lithium-reserves-in-nagaur-rajasthan/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE : IANS Jaipur, If officials in Rajasthan government are to be believed, Lithium reserves have been traced in Degana (Nagaur) of Rajasthan. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) and mining officials claim that the capacity of lithium reserves found here is higher than the lithium reserves found in Jammu and Kashmir recently. It is claimed that there is so much lithium here that 80 percent of India’s total demand can be met from here. Till now India is dependent on China for lithium. Now it is believed that China’s monopoly will end and like the Gulf countries, the fortunes of Rajasthan will also rise. Lithium is a non-ferrous metal, which is used to make mobile-laptop, electric vehicle and other chargeable batteries. India is completely dependent on expensive foreign supplies for lithium. Now GSI has found large deposits of Lithium around Degana. Lithium reserves in Rajasthan have been found in the same Renvat hill of Degana and its surrounding area, from where tungsten mineral was once supplied to the country. During the British rule, the British had discovered tungsten mineral in the year 1914 on the hill of Renwat in Degana. Before independence, the tungsten produced here was used to make war material for the British Army during the First World War. After independence, it was also used in the field of making surgical instruments in energy and health sector in the country. At that time around 1500 people used to work here. In the year 1992-93, China’s cheap export policy made tungsten coming out of here expensive. Eventually, the production of tungsten was stopped here. This hill, which was inhabited all the time and helped in the development of the country by supplying tungsten for years, became deserted in a single stroke. During that period, the offices, houses, gardens and even the schools built by the officials of GSI and other government agencies were turned into ruins. Now the lithium coming out of this hill will change the fate of Rajasthan and the country, said officials. Lithium is the world’s lightest metal, needed by every battery-powered device Lithium is also the softest and lightest metal in the world. Soft enough to be cut with a vegetable knife and light enough to float when put in water. It stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy. Lithium is present in every chargeable electronic and battery-powered gadget in the house today. For this reason, there is a tremendous demand for lithium around the world. Due to the global demand, it is also called White Gold. The global value of one ton of lithium is around Rs 57.36 lakh. Energy transformation is taking place all over the world. Every country is moving fast from fuel energy to green energy. From air crafts, to wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles, mobiles and every small and big chargeable device in the house, the use of lithium is increasing. According to the World Bank report, by the year 2050, the global demand for lithium metal will increase by 500 percent. From this point of view, getting immense reserves of Lithium in Rajasthan is extremely beneficial not only for the state but also for the country’s economy. The world’s largest lithium reserves of 21 million tonnes are currently in the country of Bolivia. After this, there are also large reserves in Argentina, Chile and America. Despite this, China, which has reserves of 5.1 million tonnes of lithium, continues to have a monopoly in the global market. India also has to buy 53.76 per cent of its total lithium imports from China. In the year 2020-21, India had imported lithium worth more than Rs 6,000 crore and out of this lithium worth more than Rs 3,500 crore was bought from China. In such a situation, officials believe that the lithium deposits found in Rajasthan are so much that China’s monopoly can be completely end and the country can become self-sufficient in the matter of green energy. The story of finding lithium reserves in Rajasthan is also very interesting. On the instructions of the Central Government, the GSI survey team reached Degana to find high grade tungsten minerals. Meanwhile, the GSI survey team found the availability of lithium reserves in this area. Answering the question of Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal in Parliament on 29 March 2023, Union Minister of Mines and Parliamentary Affairs Prahlad Joshi had told that survey is being done by GSI in Renwat hill and its surrounding area in Degana, Rajasthan for discovery of high grade quality tungsten. In the indications so far, the GSI survey team has found deposits of high quality tungsten as well as lithium and 4 other minerals in the G2 stage survey. Officials confirmed that lithium deposits have been found near Degana during the search for tungsten by the GSI survey team. There is a possibility of lithium deposits in some other places including Barmer, Jaisalmer. They informed that the survey team is expediting the exploration work of lithium. So that auction can be done for mining by exploration of G2 stage here as soon as possible."

The terrorist group is known for its use of technology to recruit and radicalize individuals from all over the world. The Indian intelligence agencies have reportedly identified several online platforms used by the ISIS to reach out to potential recruits in the tech industry. These platforms include social media networks, job portals, and websites that offer free online courses. The ISIS is said to be particularly interested in recruiting individuals with expertise in areas such as cyber security, cryptography, and software development. These individuals are seen as valuable assets to the terrorist group as they can help develop and improve its online propaganda and communication capabilities. The Indian government has been taking steps to counter the threat posed by the ISIS, including monitoring online activities and cracking down on recruitment networks. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also been working with the tech industry to raise awareness about the potential dangers of online radicalization and to promote digital literacy and cyber security among the public. In light of these developments, it is essential that individuals working in the tech industry in India remain vigilant and exercise caution when engaging with online platforms. It is also important that the government continues to take proactive measures to counter the threat posed by the ISIS and ensure the safety and security of its citizens."

Pakistan To Release 199 Jailed Indian Fishermen On Friday,https://idrw.org/pakistan-to-release-199-jailed-indian-fishermen-on-friday/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE : PTI Pakistani authorities are expected to go ahead with its goodwill gesture to release on Friday 199 Indian fishermen arrested for allegedly fishing illegally in the country’s waters, despite the death of an Indian civilian who was to be repatriated with them. Kazi Nazir, a top police official in the jail and corrections department in Sindh, said that they had been told by relevant government ministries to prepare for the release and repatriation of 199 fishermen on Friday. These fishermen will be sent to Lahore and handed over to Indian authorities at the Wagah border. Currently, these fishermen are lodged at the Landhi jail here. He said the goodwill gesture process appeared on the course although an Indian civilian prisoner, Zulfiqar, who was to be repatriated with the fishermen died in a hospital in Karachi on Saturday due to an illness. “According to officials at Landhi jail the Indian prisoner had complained about high fever and chest problems and his condition deteriorated last week so he was sent to the hospital where he passed away due to apparent lung infection,” he said. An official of Edhi Welfare Trust, which usually arranges for the safe transportation of these Indian fishermen to Lahore and provides other help in jails, said that Zulfiqar’s death was not a mystery as conditions in the Landhi and Malir jails are far from ideal and prisoners with poor health and chronic ailments struggle to get regular proper treatment. “Prison doctors or the hospital are generally not equipped to deal with serious ailments and recommend sending the patient to hospital but sometimes it is too late,” the official said. According to the Pakistan India People’s Forum for Peace and Democracy, at present 631 Indian fishermen and one civilian prisoner are still in the Landhi and Malir jails in Karachi despite completing their prison sentences. Adil Sheikh, who works with the forum in Karachi, said that these Indian fishermen all ended up in Pakistani jails after being arrested for allegedly violating the marine territorial demarcation treaty between Pakistan and India. “Nearly all of them are poor illiterate people,” he added. In the past as well, a few Indian civilian prisoners have died in hospitals because of illnesses, as per prison authorities. A total of 654 Indian fishermen are languishing in Karachi jails while an estimated 83 Pakistani fishermen are in Indian jails. Out of the 654 Indian fishermen, 631 have completed their sentences and are awaiting repatriation. Pakistan and India regularly arrest rival fishermen for violating the maritime boundary, which is poorly marked at some points."

The IAF plans to retire 150 aircraft by 2035 and an additional 100 by 2040, highlighting the need for new aircraft to maintain its combat capabilities. With concerns raised about the dwindling strength of the Air Force, the IAF is looking to ramp up its modernization programs to avoid hitting rock bottom in the next 10 years. The IAF has been grappling with the challenges of an ageing fleet for some time now, with many of its aircraft nearing the end of their operational lifespan. The retirement of these aircraft will create a significant gap in the IAF’s combat capabilities, underscoring the need for new aircraft to fill the void. Due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, plans to procure an additional 12 Su-30MKI and 21 Mig-29UPG fighter jets have been put on hold and may even be cancelled in the long term. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is now pinning its hopes on the 73 Tejas Mk1A fighter jets, which were scheduled to be delivered from February 2022 onwards, but reports suggest that even their timeline might shift further. To address concerns over dwindling combat capabilities, the IAF is looking to bolster its combat fleet by acquiring an additional 50-60 Tejas Mk1A jets. With the Tejas Mk2 program facing more expected delays, the IAF is relying on further Tejas Mk1A orders to fill the void left by the retiring Jaguar fleet post-2028. The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has assured a rollout of the Tejas Mk2 program in 2025-26, with the first flight in 2026-27 and production of the aircraft expected to commence in 2028-29. However, given the aggressive timeline, delays were expected, and production of the Tejas Mk1A will continue for another three years. The procurement plans for 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) under a tender are currently delayed, and it may take another 3-4 years to finalize the contract, followed by an additional 5 years for the induction of the first aircraft, which could be as late as 2031. While the Indian government had initially considered acquiring an additional 36 Dassault Rafale jets separate from the MRFA tender, these plans were scrapped. However, talks with Dassault for a possible direct deal between the two countries to acquire 90 jets are still ongoing. The Indian Air Force’s 5th generation fighter program is awaiting clearance of funds from the government for Phase-I. The program’s initial phase includes the acquisition of 40 jets powered by older F414 engines. However, delays in completing the Critical Design Review (CDR) phase have pushed back the program’s timeline. As a result, production of the MkI variant is expected to be extended by an additional 40 jets. The MkII program, which was supposed to feature a higher thrust engine, has also experienced delays and is likely to miss its target of entering production by 2035."

And Prime Minister Albanese committed to ensuring that our security forces, including our police, state police forces, take every possible action when the vandalism occurred to track down those responsible and to prosecute them.” “And I’m confident that that will happen. The point I make on perhaps the broader issue is that, as my Foreign Minister said when she was here in March unofficial referendum has no legal standing in Australia and Australia continues to respect and stand by India’s sovereignty and its sovereign borders,” he added. In the past few months, the attacks on the Hindu temple have increased. In March, Shree Laxmi Narayan Temple in Brisbane was attacked. Earlier, in January, Shri Shiva Vishnu Temple in Australia’s Carrum Downs was also vandalised with anti-Hindu graffiti.

Indian migration to Australia is the fastest-growing migration from any other country in the world. And that’s having a huge impact on our relationship. It’s strengthening our trade and economic relationship. It is furthering our people-to-people links through education and through culture. It’s ensuring that we’re doing more in relation to defence and security.” “And, of course, we’re working through the quad on a whole range of issues, including climate change and clean energy. And I think all those things are now being boosted in Australia by a growing diaspora that not only opens up the eyes of Australians to opportunities in India but also reminds their friends and relatives in India of the opportunities, particularly in education, that are on offer in Australia,” he added."

The IAF has also been unable to acquire the additional six next-generation air-to-air refuelling tanker aircraft that it requires, despite the fleet requirement being at 18 aircraft for the past two decades. In the buddy-buddy method, two fighter aircraft fly together, with one serving as the tanker and the other as the receiver. The receiving aircraft links up with the tanker aircraft and refuels from it in mid-air. This method is not as efficient as AAR with dedicated FRA but is still considered an effective way to train pilots in AAR procedures. The IAF has been striving to enhance its operational capabilities and maintain readiness to meet any potential threat. A vital component of this effort is training its pilots in AAR techniques.

The halt in the supply of spares by Russian OEMs has been due to payment issues between India and Russia. Even after the payment issue is resolved, it is unlikely that the supply of spares will reach pre-war levels due to ongoing war requirements. The new initiative seeks to ensure a steady supply of spare parts by encouraging the Russian defence industry to participate in the Indian manufacturing sector. The Indian government’s call to Russian OEMs to establish offices in India is part of the larger ‘Make in India’ initiative that seeks to boost the country’s domestic manufacturing sector.

Where is our independence, our sovereignty?” The minister said one of the proposals made to Türkiye was to send the S-400s to Ukraine. “They told us ‘Will you send to Ukraine?’ We said ‘no,’” he stated. Türkiye was excluded from the joint F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet program due to its deployment of the Russian S-400 air defense system. Meanwhile, Çavu?o?lu on May 6 said the official vehicle of the Turkish ambassador to Sudan, ?smail Çobano?lu, was hit by gunfire on May 6, but there were no causalities after the incident. “None of our brothers, ambassador, or other guards were injured. The vehicle was damaged. Discussions continue with both parties on who did this and why,” the minister said. He reminded that the clashes between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary and the Sudanese army were also taking place on the street where the embassy building was located. “For the safety of our embassy and our colleagues, we decided to move our embassy to Port Sudan with the advice of the transitional government of the army. They even helped until they got there, but when they entered the street, open fire started,” he said. The embassy staff was under gunfire despite the Turkish authorities informing both sides of the transfer of the embassy personnel to Port Sudan, he said. The minister said the embassy staff was in a safe place but would be transferred to Port Sudan."
G20 events in Kashmir “highly irresponsible”: Pakistan plays broken record,https://idrw.org/g20-events-in-kashmir-highly-irresponsible-pakistan-plays-broken-record/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Even after External Affairs Minister Jaishankar made it clear this week that Jammu and Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and holding G20 events there is completely natural, the Foreign Office (FO) of Pakistan played the same record on Sunday that EAM’s insinuations associating Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks on India’s decision to hold G20 meetings in Jammu and Kashmir were “not only mischievous but highly irresponsible”, Dawn reported. India assumed the year-long presidency of the G20 in December last year. It is set to host a leaders’ summit in early September. Last month, India released a full calendar of events leading up to the summit, which included G20 and Youth 20 meetings in Srinagar and in Leh, in the region of Ladakh, in April and May. Pakistan has “vehemently condemned” India’s move, saying such a move was “self-serving” on New Delhi’s part. FM Bilawal, during his two-day visit to India for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) moot, also “condemned” India’s decision to hold G20 meetings in Kashmir. Pakistan “condemned” the meetings while it has nothing to do anything with either G20 or Jammu and Kashmir. Responding to questions regarding the matter in a media talk after the SCO meeting, FM Bilawal had said: “Obviously we condemn it and at the time we will give such a response that it will be remembered. ” Without any right or power to be saying so, Bilawal still said that holding the meetings in the disputed territory showed India’s “pettiness” and was “a show of arrogance to the world that to hell with international law, UNSC resolutions and bilateral agreements, India will hold its events in Kashmir”. FM Bilawal also further made imaginary claims that India would soon find that “they will be unable to achieve 110 per cent attendance because other people will not compromise on their morals”. Dawn reported that in a statement issued on Sunday, FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said that the foreign minister had on his visit to India emphasised the “critical importance of relevant UN Security Council resolutions” for a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. Interfering in India’s internal matter, FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said that the Foreign Ministry had already “articulated Pakistan’s position on the G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in POK in its press release of 11 April 2023”. “Any insinuation, associating foreign minister’s remarks with a threat of violence, is not only mischievous but highly irresponsible. It is an attempt to shift focus from the Foreign Minister’s key message of conflict resolution through dialogue and in accordance with international law and UN security council resolutions,” the FO blabbered. Jaishankar brushed aside Pakistan’s objections to India hosting the G20 tourism working group meeting in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir in May. “I don’t think there is a G20 issue to debate with anybody, certainly not with a country which is nothing to do with G20. Jammu and Kashmir was, is, will always be a part of India. The G20 meetings are held in all the Indian states and Union Territories, so it is completely natural that it is held there,” Jaishankar said on Friday in a press conference after concluding the SCO Foreign Ministers Meet."

However, he said that their effort should be “to persevere, infuse that sense of confidence, to give that sense of hope, and to ensure there is security.” When asked about the investment coming from the Middle East in Kashmir and also terror funding, Jaishankar said, “Clearly, things are changing for the better when it comes to Jammu and Kashmir. But, part of what needs to keep developing is actually the economy, the employment opportunities, the whole you know the ecosystem which comes which are much you know vibrant, economy, civil society. Attempts will be made to disturb it because there are interested parties, one lives right across, so we you know, we should not expect that there will not be challenges. There will be and it’s not necessarily limited to the western neighbours, there will be others as well.” Emphasizing that the government is working to instil a sense of confidence among people and is determined to overcome challenges, he said, “So, there will be challenges but our effort should be to persevere, to infuse that sense of confidence, to give that sense of hope, to ensure there is security and that is what really the government is doing. I mean, we have to also really recognize that men and women of this country make I mean they may be in the military, they may be in the security, they may be in the governance out there, they make sacrifices for all of this to happen. I think this is something we will do, we will continue doing.” He further state, “We know there will be obstacles but we are very very determined that we will overcome that.” Taking to his official Twitter handle, Jaishankar stated, “Spoke in Mysuru on foreign policy of Modi Government. Thank the Thinkers Forum for organizing and the residents of the Palace City for attending in such large numbers. Their presence today is a statement that the world matters more to today’s India; that the Modi Government has changed the country and that involved citizens want to make informed choices in the world’s largest democracy.” During the interactive session on the Foreign Policy of the Modi Government in Mysuru, Jaishankar highlighted India’s response to global geopolitics. “I think there are moments when it is, as I said, with nice people, you are nice. With difficult people, sometimes it’s necessary to push back. But I would say this because this has been my experience in the last year,” said Jaishankar while taking questions on former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan playing his speeches, lauding India for its independent foreign policy. While addressing a rally in Lahore in 2022, Imran Khan praised India for its independent foreign policy and played out a video clip of Jaishankar. “It’s sometimes you’re made to sit and almost hold it saying, how can India do this? How do you take this position? At that stage you ask yourself saying, what do you do? Do you then be conciliatory or do you put your point of view across? And if somebody is being very self-centred, they’re only looking at their interest, their point of view, not by rights. Tell them that there are other points of view and there are other interests, etc,” Jaishankar said. Jaishankar weighed in on the foreign policy of the Union government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying there are times when people need to trust the government and understand that it is committed to its citizens abroad.”There are times when the people need to trust the government, need to understand that this is a government which has systems in place, which has a commitment to citizens abroad,” Jaishankar said in Mysuru."
"To Expand Defence Exports, Centre To Reform Military Attaches’ Deployments",https://idrw.org/to-expand-defence-exports-centre-to-reform-military-attaches-deployments/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE: ANI In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directive to increase exports, the centre is carrying out a major change in the deployments of military or defence attaches as they would be posted to countries where they can help in expanding domestic defence exports. The Department of Military Affairs and the Department of Defence are carrying out this reform soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the ways of increasing defence exports from the country at the combined commanders’ conference. “The military or the defence attaches will now be deployed in countries where they can mainly help in increasing defence exports of the country including products from both the public sector and the private sector,” senior defence officials told ANI here. This would also lead to a reduction of military officers posted in countries from where we have been importing military hardware traditionally, they said. “At a time when we have stopped importing weapon systems from abroad and are insisting on production in India under the Make in India scheme, there is no point in maintaining a significant number of attaches in countries which have been exporting weapon systems to us,” they said. India has put a virtual ban on imports and is buying only highly essential equipment from external sources and insisting on make in India. The officials said that while positing these officers, the focus would be on countries in Africa, middle eastern countries along with the friendly nations in south-east Asia which have shown interest in Indian equipment like the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles. A number of Indian public sector units have also opened offices to support the Armenian military to help increase exports. Officials said that the government is also going to allow the attaches to promote the sale of hardware manufactured by the private sector of the country. The officials said when Western countries promote the sale of their hardware in India or other countries, their military personnel accompany their sales teams to make the pitch as it is in their national interest and the same can be followed here as well. Indian side feels that the military hardware produced by it can find buyers in Africa or South East Asian countries who are looking at a constant supply at reasonable and affordable cost. The DMA led by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has been working towards increasing the defence exports along with reducing the import in the defence sector. The DMA has already issued a negative list for imports and over 400 items are there in that. India in the recent past has junked many import deals and r put them on hold like the plan to buy 33 fighter aircraft from Russia, buying high calibre guns for the Navy from the US, high altitude long endurance drones and many other items. Relaxation’s have been given to the forces to import equipment at the highest level only in the defence ministry. The Department of Defence Production under Defence Secretary Giridhar Armane has envisaged an export target of USD 5 billion by 2025. They have also been planning to use the defence trachea to achieve the export target as it is felt that they can play a pivotal role as they understand the defence requirements of the respective country and can promote the export of Indian defence products in their respective countries."
India has the most uncontrollable press: Jaishankar reacts to country’s low ranking on press index,https://idrw.org/india-has-the-most-uncontrollable-press-jaishankar-reacts-to-countrys-low-ranking-on-press-index/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE: ANI India has the most uncontrollable press, said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday in response to a question about the low ranking of India on the press index. During the interactive session on the Foreign Policy of the Modi Government, Jaishankar said, “I was amazed at our number. I thought we had the most uncontrollable press, and somebody is getting something fundamentally wrong. Comparing India’s rank with Afghanistan, EAM said, “Afghanistan was freer than us. Can you imagine? Look, these are all I mean, I see the democracy index, freedom index, religious freedom index, and press freedom index.” Terming the press index “mind games,” Jaishankar said that these are the ways of playing the mind games which are like lowering the rank of the country whom you don’t like while others do not. This statement came days after Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released their press index and ranked India at 161. While Afghanistan stood at 152. China drops to the second-lowest spot on the 2023 World Freedom Press Index, standing at 179th rank. Last year, India stood at 150th rank. This time, India falls 11 ranks. During the session, Jaishankar took a jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and said that he was taking classes in China from the Chinese ambassador. He said, “I would have offered to take classes on China from Rahul Gandhi but I discovered he was taking classes on China from the Chinese ambassador,” responding to the Congress leader’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s handling of relations with China. Jaishankar referred to Rahul Gandhi’s meeting with the Chinese ambassador to India during the Doklam crisis. He attacked the government, suggesting that new territory had been lost to China’s salami slicing. “I know everything in politics is political. I accept that. But I think on certain issues, we have a collective responsibility to at least behave in a way that we do not weaken our (India’s) collective position abroad to do what we have seen in the last three years in China,” Jaishankar said, adding, “often very misleading narratives are put in.” Jaishankar also hit out at misleading narratives and misrepresentations, adding, “We had, for example…a bridge which the Chinese were building on Pangong Tso. Now, the reality was that the particular area first Chinese came in 1959, and then they occupied it in 1962. But that’s not the way it was put across. This happened in the case of some of the so-called model villages as well, that they were built on areas which we lost in 62 or before 62. Now, I don’t believe you will very rarely hear me say 1962, that shouldn’t have happened, or you are wrong, or you are responsible. What has happened has happened. It’s our collective, I would say failure or responsibility. I do not necessarily attribute political colouring to it. I would like to see is actually a serious China conversation. I’m prepared to accept that there are different viewpoints on that, but if you reduce it to kind of slanging match, what can I say after that?”"

"Aided by Pakistan, microscopic terrorist minority fans flame of hate, extremism in UK, Europe: Report",https://idrw.org/aided-by-pakistan-microscopic-terrorist-minority-fans-flame-of-hate-extremism-in-uk-europe-report/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Amid a sharp increase in pro-Khalistani activities across the globe, a new report has emerged, revealing that the Khalistani movement at present is being fanned in US and Europe by an extremely small group of the minority of terrorists and extremists, aided and funded by Pakistan. A webinar was organised by Law and Society Alliance on ‘How Khalistanis use Western democracy to promote extremism and violence – Bloom Report.’ The webinar was centred around a 160-page report by Colin Bloom, an Independent Faith Engagement Advisor. The report talks about the means and ways in which the terrorist groups that demand a separate Khalistan have been making use of the freedom provided in Western nations, especially the UK, to fan the flames of hate and extremism and also bring violence to innocents that dare to speak up against their violent ways. According to the report, the truth is that the majority of Sikhs and Indians living abroad do not support extremism and the call for a separate Khalstan. They are deeply patriotic Indians. The Idea of Khalistan is a long dream of Pakistan. The report points out that there is a power tug-of-war between the Khalistanis and larger Sikh organisations in the UK for the control of the Gurudwaras, the Khalistanis use the gurdwaras as a means to spread their messages of hate and extremism and also to collect funding for their operations. Additionally, the Bloom report highlights that the Sikh community in the UK, which supports the Khalistan cause, is in a tiny minority but they use violence, harassment, and their influence to coerce other moderate and peaceful Sikhs to fall in line and support their ideology. Violence and intimidation go completely against the tenets of the Sikh faith, the Khalistanis in the UK and all across the world are trying to also hijack the Sikh faith and use it for their benefit. The first speaker at the webinar was Sameer Kaushal, from Sher-e-Punjab Radio based in Canada. He started by stating that this 159-page report is extremely comprehensive and recorded the answers of 2100 respondents. He added that according to the report, people are divided into three categories, True Believers, who are generous and kind and follow the teachings of their faith, then there are some who do not believe in a higher power, these people are also largely peaceful and kind, and lastly, there are the make-believers, these comprise of people and individuals that do believe in religion but use their religion as a justification of violence and personal greed. He also said the majority of Sikhs in the UK have perfectly assimilated with life in Britain and benefit British society. It is only a small vocal minority of extremists that use aggressive tactics to propagate their beliefs. Kaushal then goes on to narrate his own experience of how he was attacked and harassed by Khalistani activists during an event organised by the Indian High Commission in Surrey, Canada. While attempting to enter the event, Kaushal was labelled as anti-Sikh even if he is from Punjab. Kaushal then had to leave the event for their safety and the mob of extremists were turning hostile and violent against him. He added that the report clearly shows that some places of Sikh worship have been taken over by Khalistani elements and these places are then used as tools of violence and hate propaganda to please Pakistan. Kaushal goes on to add that these extremists are brainwashing the youth and creating a false narrative that the Indian state is hostile towards the Sikhs, which is not true. Kaushal has even interviewed Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the Legal Counsel for Sikhs for Justice, asking him why Khalistani extremists demand that Khalistan be carved out of the Indian side of Punjab and not the one that lies in Pakistan. Unsurprisingly, Punnun did not have a satisfactory answer. This raises a lot of questions — who is truly behind the call for Khalistan? The majority of Sikhs have no opinion on it and wish to live in peace and harmony. The next speaker was Mahajan. He started by saying that Western democracies are giving too much freedom of speech to these extremists, this allows these extremists to freely propagate their message of hate and secession. In the garb of the freedom of speech and freedom of protest, Khalistanis force the governments of the UK, Canada, and other Western countries to allow their protests and actions, Mahajan said, adding that they are using the values of the country’s democracy against them. He further claimed that even the gurdwaras of Canada have become breeding grounds for extortionists and crime due to the influence of Khalistani extremists. Canadian law does not allow questioning of the finances of religious institutions, thus allowing Khalistani extremists to use the money from these places of worship for their extremist agenda, he noted. The basic premise of Khalistanis as presented in the Bloom report is correct, he said, adding that their use of religious sentiments for their benefits is correct. Most of the Indian diaspora are peace-loving and wish just to live with their families but extremists create a false narrative that the Indian diaspora is anti-India.

India tried to help out in Russia-Ukraine conflict: S Jaishankar,https://idrw.org/india-tried-to-help-out-in-russia-ukraine-conflict-s-jaishankar/,"May 8, 2023","SOURCE: ANI External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that India has tried to help out in the Russia-Ukraine conflict not because China did something but because the situation in Ukraine deserved that. While speaking at an interactive session on the Foreign Policy of the Modi Government, EAM Jaishankar spoke on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and said that India has been trying to help out in the situation. “The Chinese have put forward their thoughts as is their right. They have also made a contribution to whatever has happened between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” Jaishankar said. The UAE downgraded relations with Iran after Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran in January 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran following Riyadh’s execution of a prominent Shiite cleric. The animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia had previously threatened stability and security in the Gulf, and fuelled conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria. However, in a significant breakthrough in March this year, Riyadh announced that it would re-establish ties with Tehran in a China-brokered deal, marking a change in years of hostility between the two nations. However, Jaishankar said, “It’s not a zero-sum game between us.” Jaishankar further said, “I’m not competing with anyone. if I do something in Ukraine, I will not do it because China did something in Ukraine. I will do it because the situation in Ukraine deserves that.” “The fact is, in different ways, we have tried to help out since the start of the conflict. In fact, Prime Minister Modi has been among the leaders in frequent touch with Presidents Putin and Zelensky. I have been in touch with my counterparts,” Jaishankar spoke on efforts made by India in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Jaishankar also said that India has supported others who are trying to take the lead. “Today is a very complicated world. A lot of problems, a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty. A part of diplomacy is to develop a reputation as a stabilizing country, as a helpful country and as one with more friends and less adversaries,” Jaishankar said. “(Suppose) I need 20 years of peace, but obviously I need peace on terms which are conducive to my national security. So that’s really the kind of direction,” Jaishankar said giving an example."

Chinese Next-Gen WS-19 engine faces Supply chain issues,https://idrw.org/chinese-next-gen-ws-19-engine-faces-supply-chain-issues/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: API At a recent aviation investment summit in Tianjin, China, a senior official from a local aerospace materials research facility announced that China has completed development of its next-generation indigenous military aircraft engines. The official revealed that developmental bottlenecks for the WS-19 and WS-20 turbofans, as well as an unidentified next-generation engine, have been surmounted. However, material supply chain issues for the advanced alloys that will be used in the engines’ production still need to be resolved. The WS-19 afterburning turbofan is being developed to power the Shenyang J-35, a next-generation fighter jet designed for China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy. Meanwhile, the WS-20 is a high-bypass turbofan engine intended to power the Xi’an Y-20 airlifters operated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. At present, the Y-20 is powered by the Russian D-30KP low-bypass turbofan, which is also used by the Xi’an H-6J/K/N bombers of both armed services. The official also confirmed that the WS-15 afterburning turbofan is ready for mass production. The engine will be used for later variants of the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters of the PLAAF. Rated at 181 kilonewtons, the WS-15 is expected to provide a supercruise capability for the J-20, allowing it to attain supersonic cruise speeds without the use of its afterburner, which reduces fuel consumption. The official further claimed that China had achieved “98% localization” for the WS-10C engine that powers the J-20s currently being delivered to the PLAAF. Other variants of the WS-10 are also used in China’s Chengdu J-10, Shenyang J-11B, and J-16 fighter fleets. Although the official did not provide details on the remaining 2% input, it is likely related to components or materials that China still sources from foreign providers."

OPINION : US Recognizes India as Equal to NATO Ally while it Denies Sale of High-End Military Equipment,https://idrw.org/opinion-us-recognizes-india-as-equal-to-nato-ally-while-it-denies-sale-of-high-end-military-equipment/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: DEEPAK HILORI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Although the US has often claimed that India is a trading partner equal to its NATO allies, there have been instances where the US denied state-of-the-art defense hardware that India wanted. One such instance was when India was interested in acquiring Israel’s Arrow 2 anti-ballistic missiles, but the US did not give export clearance for it. Another instance was when the US offered India its Patriot PAC-3 and THAAD Air Defense system to thwart India’s purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system. However, the US has not provided India with the General Atomics MQ-20 Avenger (Predator C) that the Indian Air Force wanted to bolster its offensive capabilities, despite offering the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator armed drone to India in the past. The US’s reluctance to provide India with high-end military equipment has frustrated India, which seeks to modernize its defense forces and bolster its strategic position in the Indo-Pacific region. India is keen to expand its defense cooperation with the US, but it has also been diversifying its defense procurement sources to reduce its dependence on any single supplier. The recent AUKUS deal has highlighted the US’s reluctance to provide high-end military equipment to India. While the US has cleared the deal to supply Virginia class nuclear submarines to Australia, a country that shares no border with China and has no disputes over sea lanes, India, on the other hand, has been left wanting despite its high alertness due to frequent border standoffs with China. The Chinese claim over several thousands of kilometers of Indian land as their own has led to a need for India to beef up its military capabilities to deter any potential threat from its neighbor. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led the US to urge India to sever its ties with Russia, but so far, the US has not made any significant efforts to provide alternative military hardware to India. Furthermore, the sanctions imposed on the Russian banking system have had a detrimental effect on India’s security and defense grid, causing a shortage of spare parts for Russian equipment. This situation could potentially compromise India’s military readiness in the event of a conflict with China, as China could potentially exploit India’s lack of spare parts to gain the upper hand.

Imran blasts FM Bilawal for trip to India,https://idrw.org/imran-blasts-fm-bilawal-for-trip-to-india/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: DAWN PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday strongly criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for their foreign trips amid the country’s current “crises”. PM Shehbaz is currently in the UK for the coronation of King Charles III while FM Bilawal visited India on Thursday to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Foreign Ministers. Imran took aim at the two while addressing a PTI rally from inside his vehicle in Lahore held to show support and solidarity with the Supreme Court, Constitution and Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial. “Pakistan is being humiliated in the world. How the Indian foreign minister’s behaviour was when Bilawal went to India is a basis for shame for all of us. We ask the question, Bilawal you are touring the entire world but first tell that before going do you ask anyone that you’re spending the country’s money on a trip so what will be the benefit or loss from it?” Imran questioned what benefit was gained from the trip to India with the kind of language that the Indian foreign minister used. India’s Minister for External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, in his remarks at the SCO meet, had said terrorism in all its forms, including cross-border terrorism, must be stopped, usually a reference to Pakistan. “We firmly believe that there can be no justification for terrorism and it must be stopped in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.” Later, he had alleged that Pakistan backed terrorists in Kashmir and Bilawal’s position was “found out and called out”. Not holding back his words for the latter, Imran pointedly remarked against Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar’s manners. “Don’t you have any culture or etiquette that a guest comes to your country — either don’t invite them but to invite and then humiliate them like this reflects [poorly] on India. This arrogance of yours I’m seeing, remember it is God’s law that the powerful do not always remain so and the weak do not always remain so as well.” Turning to the prime minister, Imran asked him what he was doing in the UK. “Do you have the time for that? Don’t you know that two days back six soldiers were martyred and seven teachers in Parachinar were shot? Inflation is at historic [levels]. How could you leave the country and go there (UK) in such conditions?” PM Shehbaz earlier today deplored how the PTI tried to make Pakistan’s participation in the SCO meeting controversial, terming it as “deeply troubling”. “It shouldn’t be surprising though as Imran Niazi has had no qualms about imperilling the country’s vital foreign policy interests in the past too,” the premier said. “This is what they did in power.” He added that the conduct of interstate relations for the PTI was merely “a plaything”. Meanwhile, Imran criticised the state of the country, saying that inflation was three times higher than the time the PTI was removed from power and people’s purchasing power was diminished. He said Pakistan would rise up and the PTI would establish the rule of law and make a great country, but, elections were needed before that. Imran said the time had come for the nation to venture forth, saying that he was taking to the streets too despite the threat to his life. The PTI chief said a senior military officer, who he has referred to as “Dirty Harry” on multiple occasions before, would be responsible if anything happened to him. He added that he would be holding protest rallies from next week till May 14, saying that he would not rest until elections were held."
Thales Faces French Corruption Probe Over India Mirage Contract,https://idrw.org/thales-faces-french-corruption-probe-over-india-mirage-contract/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: BLOOMBERG Defence company Thales SA faces a bribery probe by French prosecutors into a $2.5 billion contract it won to modernize the Indian Air Force’s fleet of Dassault Mirage 2000 planes. A preliminary investigation has been opened into allegations by Sanjay Bhandari, who said in a court case that he served as a middleman to help Thales win the contract, according to a person familiar with the probe. The case focuses on whether payments to Bhandari were hidden bribes, the person said, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. Thales has never been questioned by prosecutors on the subject, a company spokeswoman said. Thales “strongly disputes” the allegations regarding alleged payments made by the company in connection with the project, she said. A lawyer who represents Bhandari in London said he couldn’t comment on a probe in France. Thales shares fell 3.5% to €132.00 at 3:11 p.m. in Paris. Dassault Aviation SA, which makes the Mirage planes and owns 25% of Thales, dropped 2.6% to €168.10. France Info reported earlier Friday on the bribery investigation. According to France Info’s report, Bhandari sued to recover money he says Thales still owed to him for helping it win the contract, a claim that was rejected by a French commercial court in October. Thales had no contract with Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project, the company spokeswoman said."
Kashmir issue should be resolved as per UN resolutions: China,https://idrw.org/kashmir-issue-should-be-resolved-as-per-un-resolutions-china/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: PTI China said on Saturday that the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan was left over from history and should be resolved as per the UN resolutions while avoiding any unilateral action. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang arrived in Pakistan on Friday for a two-day visit, which is his first trip to the country. He co-chaired a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Saturday. The two sides issued a joint statement at the conclusion of the 4th round of the ‘Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue’ in Islamabad. According to the statement, the entire range of bilateral relations and cooperation, including in political, strategic, economic, defence security, education and cultural domains was reviewed while regional and global issues of mutual interest were also discussed during the dialogue. It stated that both sides underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the need for the resolution of all outstanding disputes. “The Chinese side reiterated that the Kashmir dispute was left over from history between India and Pakistan and should be properly and peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. “Both sides opposed any unilateral actions that further complicate the already volatile situation,” according to the statement. India has previously criticised China and Pakistan for their unwarranted references to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. “We have consistently rejected such statements and all parties concerned are well aware of our clear position on these matters. The Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir and the Union Territory of Ladakh are and always will be integral and inalienable parts of India. No other country has locus standi to comment on the same,” the Ministry of External Affairs said last year when the two close allies mentioned the Kashmir issue in a joint statement. China and Pakistan also agreed on continuing their enduring support on issues concerning each other’s core national interests, the joint statement said. “Reaffirming Pakistan’s special place in China’s neighbourhood diplomacy, the Chinese side reiterated its firm support for Pakistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as its unity, stability, and economic prosperity,” it read. The Pakistani side reiterated its commitment to the “One China” policy as well as its firm support to China on all core issues of its national interest, including Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and the South China Sea. “Reaffirming their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC, both sides noted with satisfaction the steady progress of CPEC projects,” according to the statement. Both sides reiterated that CPEC is an open and inclusive platform for win-win cooperation and invited third parties to maximise benefits from it. The two sides reviewed the progress of various projects at Gwadar and reiterated their resolve to turn the region into a high-quality port and a hub for trade and connectivity. The two foreign ministers underlined that Pakistan-China friendship was a historic reality and a conscious choice of the two nations, the statement said. The Pakistani side expressed gratitude to the Chinese side for its economic and financial support and its generous assistance package for post-flood reconstruction and rehabilitation. The two sides reiterated their firm resolve to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, it said. The Chinese side appreciated the measures taken by Pakistan to ensure enhanced security of Chinese projects, personnel and institutions in Pakistan, as well as the steps are taken to apprehend and bring to justice the perpetrators targeting Chinese nationals in Dasu, Karachi and other attacks, it added. The two sides agreed to further build on the cooperation in security and counter-terrorism domains. The two sides underscored the need for the international community to provide continued assistance and support to Afghanistan including through unfreezing of the country’s overseas financial assets."

Censors in China deleting videos about poverty,https://idrw.org/censors-in-china-deleting-videos-about-poverty/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Due to propaganda and censorship, many people in China are not aware of how prevalent poverty is in the country, The New York Times reported. Recently, a video of a retiree went viral that showed what groceries she could buy with 100 yuan, or USD 14.50, roughly her monthly pension and sole source of income. The video was later deleted by Chinese authorities. A singer vented the widespread frustration among young, educated Chinese about their dire finances and gloomy job prospects, like gig work. “I wash my face every day, but my pocket is cleaner than my face,” he sings. “I went to college to help rejuvenate China, not to deliver meals.” His song was banned and his social media accounts were suspended, as per The New York Times. Last year, a migrant worker labouring hard to support his family, gained widespread sympathy and attention after he tested positive for COVID-19, and officials released extensive details of his movements. He became known as the hardest-working person in China. Censors blocked discussions about him, and local authorities were stationed outside his house to prevent journalists from visiting his wife. According to China, it is a socialist country that aims to promote common prosperity. In 2021, its top leader, Xi Jinping, declared “a comprehensive victory in the battle against poverty.” Yet many people remain poor or live just above the poverty line. With the country’s economic prospects dimming and the people’s increasing anxiety about their future, poverty has become a taboo subject that can draw ire from the government. The Cyberspace Administration of China in March announced that it would crack down on anyone who publishes videos or posts that “deliberately manipulate sadness, incite polarization, create harmful information that damages the image of the Party and the government, and disrupts economic and social development.” It bans sad videos of old people, disabled people and children. According to The New York Times, behind the ban is a government eager to keep all talk about China positive. The Communist Party brags about how many people it lifted out of poverty in the past four decades, while refusing to mention how it had thrown the entire nation into abject poverty under Mao Zedong. Poverty alleviation is a medal the party flaunts to claim its legitimacy. But despite China’s rise as an economic power, it has a drastically inadequate social safety net, and the government is eager to block any discussion of the conditions poor people face. Searching the Chinese word “pinkun,” or poverty, on the country’s biggest news portal, qq.com, the top news item is about research that shows poverty is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The news media seldom report poverty’s systemic causes in China, as per The New York Times."

"Russia, India in talks over absence of mutual transactions inrupees: Lavrov",https://idrw.org/russia-india-in-talks-over-absence-of-mutual-transactions-inrupees-lavrov/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: UNI Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday said that Russia and India are in discussions over the way forward in converting into another currency the billions of rupees of Russian money accumulated in Indian banks, in order for Moscow to use it. Asked at his press conference in Panaji, Goa on the sidelines of the SCO foreign ministers’ meet, to comment on reports that talks between Russia and India on using their national currencies in mutual settlements have been suspended, he said that the absence of mutual transactions in rupees with India is a problem for Russia. “As for the rupees, this is a problem, because we have accumulated billions of rupees in accounts in Indian banks, and we need to use this money. But to use it, these rupees need to be transferred in another currency, and this is being discussed now,” Lavrov said. Asked if the drone terror attack over the Kremlin was discussed during his talks with EAM S Jaishankar, he said that it was not discussed in detail. “We didn’t discuss in detail the terrorist attack on the Kremlin; we know the position of India, which is in favour of stopping any provocations, any terrorist attacks; there is no doubt about this.” He also said that the attending foreign ministers had prepared a capacious package of documents for the SCO Leaders’ Summit, including the political declaration, and a number of documents on combating radicalization, as well as on digital transformation and healthcare. “We have a common vision of the problems that are now being witnessed on the world stage. And there is a common desire to coordinate our actions both in the UN and on the Eurasian continent with such structures as the Eurasian Economic Union, with ASEAN, with the BRICS countries,” Lavrov said, according to Izvestia. On the issue of the creation of a common currency of the SCO countries, Lavrov said that such an initiative was being discussed, but so far the attitude towards greater use of national currencies prevails among member countries. He also said that the SCO ministers agreed to intensify the SCO-Afghanistan contact group. Lavrov said the situation in Afghanistan requires quite urgent measures. According to the Russian FM, the US is “again trying to intervene” in Afghan affairs and is not leaving any attempt to reintroduce its military infrastructure into the region around Afghanistan, to Central Asia. “Everyone perfectly understands the grave danger that such attempts are fraught with,” Lavrov emphasized. Sergey Lavrov said that all the SCO foreign ministers condemned the Kremlin drone terrorist. “It was clearly a hostile act. It is clear that without the knowledge of hosts Kiev terrorists could not have committed it. And we will not answer by talking about whether it is casus belli or not, but we will respond with concrete actions,” he added. “In Moscow they see a growing understanding that the problems that arose as a result of the actions of the United States and their satellites to pump Ukraine with weapons to counter Russia cannot be solved, only freezing the contact line in Donbass.” “Everyone understands the geopolitical nature of what is happening, understands that without resolving the main geopolitical problem, which consists in the desire of the West to maintain its hegemony and dictate to everyone and all its will, no crises in Ukraine or other parts of the world, it is impossible to solve,” he emphasized. At the same time, Lavrov declared Moscow’s readiness to conduct a dialogue with the West. “This conversation will take place sooner or later,” he said, Izvestia reported."

The national security advisers (NSAs) of these countries will meet in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, where the proposal will be discussed. The proposed initiative would involve connecting Arab countries in the Levant and the Gulf through a network of railways that will also connect to India through seaports in the Gulf. The US National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, is expected to push the idea during the meeting. Interestingly, discussions about a joint infrastructure programme were initiated over 18 months ago in a forum called I2U2, which comprises India, Israel, the US, and the UAE. The forum was established in late 2021 to discuss strategic infrastructure projects in the Middle East. During a speech earlier this week at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Sullivan hinted that he would pick up where the discussion left off: “If you remember nothing else from my speech, remember I2U2 because you will be hearing more about it as we go forward.” If the proposal for a joint railway infrastructure materializes, it could lead to significant improvements in the transportation and trade sectors, and could also provide a boost to the economies of the countries involved."

However, the people of Kashmir have always hoped for more. With the news of a G20 tourism working group meeting to be held between May 22 and 24 in Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir, the people of the region are ecstatic. They hope that the meeting will bring about more employment opportunities and help in the development of the region. The G20 meeting is a platform for the world’s largest economies to come together and discuss important issues that affect the global economy. The member countries of the G20 contribute to more than 80 per cent of the world’s GDP, and their decisions have a significant impact on the world economy. The decision to hold the meeting in Srinagar is a testament to the potential of the region and the people’s resilience in the face of adversity. The people of Kashmir have always been known for their hospitality and warmth, and they are ready to welcome the delegates from the G20 countries with open arms. The government of Jammu and Kashmir has been working tirelessly to ensure that the meeting goes smoothly, and the delegates have a comfortable stay. One of the biggest issues that the people of Kashmir face is unemployment. The region has a high literacy rate, but the lack of job opportunities has forced many people to migrate to other parts of the country in search of work. The people of Kashmir hope that the G20 meeting will bring about more investment in the region, which will create more job opportunities for the local people. The region has immense potential for tourism, and the people of Kashmir have been working hard to showcase their culture and hospitality to the world. The G20 meet will be an excellent opportunity for the delegates to experience the beauty of the region and witness the rich culture of the Kashmiri people. The region has some of the most beautiful lakes, gardens, and mountains in the world, and the people of Kashmir are ready to show them off to the world. The G20 meet will also be an opportunity for the people of Kashmir to showcase their talent and skills. The region has a rich tradition of handicrafts, and the local artisans are known for their intricate work. The delegates will have an opportunity to see some of the most beautiful handicrafts in the world and appreciate the hard work that goes into making them. Mir Tajamul Islam, a law student hailing from Pulwama district says G20 can play a role in promoting economic development in the region, which could potentially help improve the situation in Kashmir. The G20 could encourage investment in the region, promote trade, and support infrastructure development, all of which could help create new economic opportunities in Kashmir. “G20 could potentially play a role in supporting economic development in the region, which could be a step towards a more stable and prosperous future for Kashmir,” Tajamul added. The people of Kashmir have been through a lot in the past few decades. The region has witnessed violence, political instability, and economic hardship. However, the people of Kashmir have always remained resilient and hopeful. The decision to hold the G20 meet in Srinagar is a testament to the potential of the region and the people’s resilience. The people of Kashmir hope that the G20 meet will be a turning point for the region. They hope that the meeting will bring about more investment in the region, create more job opportunities, and help in the development of the region. The people of Kashmir are ready to welcome the delegates from the G20 countries and show them the warmth and hospitality that the region is known for. Bilal Ahmad Dar, hailing from the bordering area of North Kashmir’s district Baramulla said that G20 is a critical forum for international cooperation, bringing together the world’s major economies and driving collective action to address global challenges. I believe the G20 meeting in Kashmir will create a positive environment for tourism promotion, economic development, and humanitarian assistance, which can have a positive impact on the region. “It will promote economic development in the region, which can in turn help alleviate some of the socio-economic grievances”. “The decision to hold the G20 meet in Srinagar has given the people of Kashmir a reason to hope. The meeting will bring about more investment opportunities in the region, create more job opportunities, and help in the development of the region. The people of Kashmir are ready to welcome the delegates from the G20 countries and show them the beauty and hospitality of the region,” Bilal added."
Longer Range BrahMos SLCM for Project-75I under consideration,https://idrw.org/longer-range-brahmos-slcm-for-project-75i-under-consideration/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG BrahMos Aerospace and the Indian Navy are currently negotiating the development of a submarine-launched cruise missile based on the BrahMos. The missile is expected to have a range of 800-1000km and will be launched from the Vertical Launch Systems (VLS) of a submarine that is under consideration for the six submarines that are to be acquired as part of Project-75I. The BrahMos Supersonic cruise missile had previously demonstrated the capability to be launched from a pontoon-based silo at a depth of 40-50 meters several years ago. However, as the Indian Navy did not possess submarines equipped with a Vertical Launching System (VLS) at that time, the previous variant had a limited range of 300km. The program successfully achieved all its mission objectives, including the technology required to launch cruise missiles from a dived submarine using a pontoon-based silo. As part of Project-75I and Project-76, the Indian Navy’s future submarines, which are expected to be acquired in the next 20 years, will be equipped with Vertical Launching Systems (VLS). The submarines will be fitted with sub-sonic Cruise missile variants of the Long-Range Land Attack Cruise Missile (LRLACM) and BrahMos SLCM, enhancing their operational capabilities and strengthening India’s defence preparedness. In addition to the previously mentioned developments, BrahMos Aerospace is currently working on the BRAHMOS-NG, which is capable of being launched from submarine torpedo tubes and has a range of 300km. This technology can also be retrofitted onto the current Kalvari-class submarines, further augmenting their capabilities and enhancing the Indian Navy’s defence preparedness."
India to develop Next-Gen BMD Radar that can track Decoys,https://idrw.org/india-to-develop-next-gen-bmd-radar-that-can-track-decoys/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG India has implemented a two-tiered Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system to intercept hostile Ballistic Missiles and is currently developing a new set of Long-Range Discrimination Radar systems that will be capable of tracking incoming missiles while differentiating lethal warheads from decoys or other non-lethal objects. Although India already possesses Long-Range Ballistic Missile Defence Radars that can track missile launches and their reentry, allowing for the prediction of target areas before an Interceptor missile can be launched at the hostile missile or its warhead, adversaries can potentially overwhelm India’s defences with multiple decoy launches. The purpose of developing new radar systems is to bolster the layered BMD defence system, resulting in improved tracking of decoys, which in turn allows for the launch of interceptors solely at lethal warheads. According to sources familiar with the matter told idrw, the development of these radars is still in its early stages and is anticipated to be completed within the next 4-5 years, after which developmental testing can commence."

Terrorists in Kashmir shift tactics: using caves and avoiding electronic communication,https://idrw.org/terrorists-in-kashmir-shift-tactics-using-caves-and-avoiding-electronic-communication/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: API The security forces are facing significant challenges in detecting and neutralizing militants in the Poonch and Rajouri sectors, particularly near the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir. The difficult terrain and thick forests in the area, coupled with the absence of chatter or telephonic and electronic conversations between the militants, their network of supporters, and their Pakistan-based handlers, have made it increasingly difficult for government agencies to establish contact and locate their whereabouts. The militants are changing their strategy to avoid detection, leaving no footprints and avoiding any form of communication that could reveal their locations. The absence of electronic or telephonic conversations has significantly hindered the government’s efforts to identify and neutralize the militants. The presence of natural caves in the area is also proving advantageous for the militants, providing them with shelter and reducing their reliance on local overground support networks. The ongoing operation, known as ‘Trinetra,’ involves the Indian Army, state police, and the CRPF, who are working together to detect and counter the militants involved in the ambush that resulted in the loss of five Indian Army soldiers in the Kandi forest area under Rajouri sector on Friday. Despite the challenges, the troops were successful in eliminating one terrorist and injuring another in a gunfight. The swath near the LoC south of the Pirpanjal Range consists of dense forests that stretch from the LoC leading to the mountains. The area is incredibly challenging for the forces to effectively cordon off, making it even more challenging to locate and neutralize the militants. In 2021, the Indian Army conducted a nearly three-week-long operation to hunt terrorists hiding in the forested swath near the Bhatta Durian region after nine Indian Army soldiers lost their lives in a terrorist attack. Since May 3, the troops have been on the trail of an unspecified number of terrorists who reportedly blew up an army truck on April 20 and killed five soldiers near Bhatta Durian on the Bhimber Gali-Surankote highway, just about 8-9 km aerial distance away from the LoC, based on specific intelligence."
Ukraine claims Patriot PAC-3 shootdown Russia’s Hypersonic Kh-47 Kinzhal Missile,https://idrw.org/ukraine-claims-patriot-pac-3-shootdown-russias-hypersonic-kh-47-kinzhal-missile/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: API On May 5, 2023, “Defense Express,” the Ukrainian defense website, reported that the Ukrainian air defense had achieved a significant victory by intercepting a Russian Kh-47 Kinzhal hypersonic missile. The successful interception was carried out using the highly advanced American Patriot PAC-3 air defense missile system. The Kinzhal missile is a cutting-edge Russian weapon that is considered to be among the most advanced in its arsenal. The military claims that this air-launched ballistic missile has an impressive range of up to 2,000km (1,250 miles) and can fly at a speed ten times faster than sound, making it an incredibly challenging target to intercept. According to Oleshchuk, the Kh-47 missile was fired from Russian territory by a MiG-31K aircraft and was successfully neutralized by a single Patriot missile. The Ukrainian military had previously acknowledged a shortage of resources to intercept this supersonic weapon. The American Patriot PAC-3 air defense missile system is a highly advanced weapon system that is designed to intercept both tactical ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. Its capability to intercept hypersonic missiles, such as the Kh-47 Kynzhal, demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the system in the modern battlefield. In conclusion, the successful interception of the Russian Kh-47 Kynzhal hypersonic missile by the Ukrainian air defense using the American Patriot PAC-3 air defense missile system is a remarkable accomplishment. It highlights the strength and competence of the Ukrainian air defense forces and their dedication to safeguarding their nation’s sovereignty."

A note has been circulated to all the defence forces along with other important stake holders by the ceremonial branch of the Ministry of Defence which organises the Republic Day parade in coordination with all other ministries and departments, defence sources told ANI. “After detailed deliberations, it has been decided that Republic Day 2024 will have women participation, including contingents (marching and bands), tableaux and performances during the parade at the Kartavya Path,” they said. The Defence Ministry has apprised other ministries including Home Affairs, Culture and Urban Development about the decision to hold the all women parade in the coming year. In recent years, the defence forces and paramilitary contingents have chosen women contingent commanders and deputy commanders in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drive to promote women’s participation in all possible roles in the military as they have been given command opportunities along with deployment in combat roles. Due to such opportunities, women have been able to be fighter pilots in the Indian Air Force and have also been inducted into Army as jawans. Recently, the Army also opened up the Regiment of Artillery for women officers."
"China, Pakistan mention Kashmir in a joint statement",https://idrw.org/china-pakistan-mention-kashmir-in-a-joint-statement/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Just a day after Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was rebuked by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar at the SCO Foreign Ministers meeting, China and Pakistan mentioned Kashmir in their joint statement. The joint statement was issued after the fourth round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue led by Bilawal and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. “Both sides underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia, and the need for resolution of all outstanding disputes. The Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the latest developments of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,” read the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release. However, the Chinese side reiterated that the Kashmir dispute was left over from history between India and Pakistan and should be properly and peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. “Both sides opposed any unilateral actions that further complicate the already volatile situation,” added the release. This comes after Jaishankar slammed Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s “weaponising terrorism” remarks. “Victims of terrorism do not sit together with perpetrators of terrorism to discuss terrorism. Victims of terrorism defend themselves, counter acts of terrorism, they call it out, they legitimise it and that is exactly what is happening. To come here and preach these hypocritical words as though we are on the same boat,” he said while addressing a press conference by the Presidency after SCO Council of Foreign Ministers. He was answering questions on India-Pakistan ties including a question from a Pakistani journalist. Answering a question about the terror incident in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday, where five soldiers lost their lives, Jaishankar said there was a shared feeling of outrage, Jaishankar said, “They are committing acts of terrorism. I don’t want to jump the gun on what happened today but we are all feeling equally outraged. On this matter, the terrorism matter, I would say that Pakistan’s credibility is depleting faster than even its Forex reserves.” “As a promoter, justifier and I am sorry to say, spokesperson of a terrorism industry which is the mainstay of Pakistan, his positions were called out and they were countered, including at the SCO meeting,” he said. India has consistently raised the issue of Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism and terrorist infiltration. It has said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have borne the brunt of this terrorism campaign for decades and continue to do so. He also brushed aside Pakistan’s objections to India hosting G20 tourism working group meeting in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir in May. “I don’t think there is a G20 issue to debate with anybody, certainly not with a country which is nothing to do with G20. Jammu and Kashmir was, is, will always be a part of India. The G20 meetings are held in all the Indian states and Union Territories, so it is completely natural that it is held there,” Jaishankar said."
Indian Army expresses gratitude to villagers for helping chopper crew after hard landing in J-K’s Kishtwar,https://idrw.org/indian-army-expresses-gratitude-to-villagers-for-helping-chopper-crew-after-hard-landing-in-j-ks-kishtwar/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Indian Army has praised the efforts of villagers of Machna in Kishtwar district and extended gratitude for providing invaluable assistance to the aircrew of an Army helicopter which made a “hard landing” in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district on Thursday. “#IndianArmy extends heartfelt gratitude to the villagers of Machna, #Kishtwar for providing timely invaluable assistance in aiding the aircrew, who made precautionary landing on banks of River Marua,” read the Tweet from Northern Command. “#IndianArmy cherishes the strong bond with the people of #JammuKashmir,” added the tweet further. In the crash an aviation technician who was among the three members on board the Army helicopter succumbed to his injuries later. On the other hand, following the crash, the Indian Army has grounded its fleet of ALH Dhruv choppers. This is the second time in the last two months that the chopper fleet has been grounded for checks. The first crash took place in Mumbai in March when a Navy chopper had ditched after performing VVIP duties. Another accident happened in Kochi in April when a Coast Guard helicopter during trials made a crash landing. “In view of the crash in which one Army jawan lost his life on May 4, operations of the ALH Dhruv choppers have been halted as a precautionary measure by the force,” Defence officials told ANI. The grounding of choppers impacted the operations as military movements had to rely on the Cheetah/ Chetak fleet even as high-intensity operations are going on in Rajouri and Baramulla against terrorist groups. The ALH Dhruv is the mainstay of the Indian Army which flies them extensively in high altitude and other operational areas."
India and China’s race for Maldives,https://idrw.org/india-and-chinas-race-for-maldives/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: ANI India continued to exercise its influence in the Maldives, particularly under the presidency of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who assumed office in 2018. The Solih administration pursued an “India-first” policy, and India committed over USD 2.71 billion (30.7 billion Maldivian rufiyaa) to various projects in the country. These included the development of a 100-bed state-of-the-art cancer hospital in Hulhumale and a 22,000-seater cricket stadium in the Maldives under the USD 800 million line of credit. India also generated a lot of goodwill in the Maldives during the Covid19 pandemic when it gifted Covishield vaccines to the Maldives in January 2021, AICIS reported. Beijing was left behind in vaccine diplomacy, as the first Chinese vaccines only reached the Maldives at the end of March 2021. India had a definite edge as it emerged as the leading producer of vaccines. India initiated the Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP) in August 2021, which is the largest infrastructure project in the Maldives. The project features a 6.74 km-long bridge and causeway connection between Male and the neighbouring islands of Villingli, Gulhifalhu, and Thilafushi, costing around USD 500 million, AICIS reported. The Hanimaadhoo international airport project’s ground-breaking ceremony was attended by India’s External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, during his visit to the Maldives in January 2023. The financing of the USD 136.6 million projects was given to India’s Exim Bank through a line of credit, and the development of the airport is being executed by Indian company JMC Projects Ltd. On 1 May 2023, Indian Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh arrived in the Maldives on a 3-day official visit at the invitation of his Maldivian counterpart, Mariya Ahmed Didi, where they held bilateral delegation-level talks to further strengthen the defence and security partnership. India also handed over a fast patrol vessel along with an assault landing craft to the Maldives National Defence Forces (MNDF) in a formal ceremony on 2 May 2023, AICIS reported. In 2012, the Maldives witnessed a political crisis that resulted in the ousting of President Mohamed Nasheed, who was perceived as pro-India. Then-Vice President Mohamed Waheed, who was viewed as being sympathetic to China, assumed power. China’s influence in the Maldives grew significantly during President Abdulla Yameen’s presidency between 2013 and 2018, with the Chinese government investing heavily in major infrastructure projects in the country, Asian Institute for China and IOR Studies (AICIS) wrote. The Maldives, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean, has been a subject of growing political interest for China in the last decade. Political and economic influence is a key aspect of China’s strategy to expand its global footprint, and the Maldives has been no exception. China’s economic influence in the Maldives has grown since 2013 as it has become a major source of investment and tourism. China also provided financial support to the Maldives in the form of grants and loans. China debt-trapped the Maldives during the presidency of Abdulla Yameen (2013-2018), during whose tenure Xi Jinping made a state visit to the Maldives in 2014 to formalise its joining of the BRI, AICIS reported. The Maldives also borrowed heavily from China to fund infrastructure projects during this period, swelling the Chinese debt to the Maldives to USD 3.4 billion. There were also several vanity infrastructure projects, like the 7,000 housing units built by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) on Hulhumale Island, including several unnecessary roads and bridges. Most of the infrastructure projects also employed Chinese engineers and foreign labourers, denying employment to locals. One of the most significant projects was the construction of a new runway at the Maldives’ main international airport, which was financed by the Chinese government and carried out by a Chinese company. The project was controversial, with critics arguing that the Maldives might struggle to repay the loans, AICIS reported. The Maldives also signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China on 7 December 2017, which was a significant milestone in their relationship. The agreement was also expected to boost economic ties between China and the Maldives, as well as facilitate greater Chinese investment in the island nation. The agreement faced severe backlash from the opposition, which claimed that it would lead to the Maldives being sold off to China. They also raised concerns about the approval process for the agreement, accusing the Committee on National Security of rushing through its approval. Many critics within the Maldives stated that the agreement would lead to a loss of nearly USD 4 billion in customs duties. The Maldives’ economic minister in 2020 also claimed that the FTA was unacceptable and should not have been signed, AICIS reported. The Maldives’ political landscape has also been shifting ahead of the 2023 presidential elections, with the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) facing internal divisions that could divide its votes. The MDP has followed an “India-first” policy under current President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and former President Mohamed Nasheed. However, Nasheed has alleged corruption and misgovernance in Solih’s administration, and there are concerns that the MDP could split into competing factions. This could benefit the opposition, but the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) is facing its own challenges, with former president Yameen currently ineligible to run for office due to a conviction for corruption and money laundering. As the Maldives gears up for presidential elections in September 2023, concerns are mounting over possible election fraud. Media freedom is also a cause for concern, with reports of violent media crackdowns under President Solih, as had happened under his predecessor, Yameen, AICIS reported. Smaller parties are fielding their candidates, increasing the possibility of the elections going into a second round. Amendments have been proposed to the General Elections Act to prevent fraud, including preserving ballot papers for 30 days after the declaration of results and broadening the criteria for bribery. The 2023 elections will have significant implications for the Maldives’ foreign policy, with India and China vying for strategic influence in the Indian Ocean. While a Solih-Nasheed alliance would be in India’s interests, China hopes for a second PPM administration to, among other things, advance its Belt and Road Initiative goals."

Defence sources said that multiple rounds of aerial surveillance using Cheetah helicopters have already been conducted by the Army since Saturday morning in different parts of Manipur. “The ongoing crisis in Manipur may create a new security dimension as insurgent groups staying in camps along the India-Myanmar border may prove detrimental to the massive efforts to restore normalcy in the state,” said a source. The issue is being addressed pro-actively by the security forces who are leaving no stone unturned to thwart the nefarious designs, the source said. “While Assam Rifles is enhancing its deployment on ground zero with round-the-clock vigil and border surveillance, the Army and other security forces are working in tandem to quell the present unrest in Manipur at the earliest,” the source said. A defence spokesman said, “The Indian Air Force ferried additional Army and paramilitary troops from two airfields in Assam employing C17 Globemaster and AN 32 aircraft. Evacuation of civilians of all communities from the affected areas is going on.” According to a top official, at least 20 people have died in Manipur since May 3, while the local media and unconfirmed reports put the toll at 50-55, including women. Manipur government’s newly-appointed security advisor Kuldiep Singh, a former CRPF chief, said that at least 18 to 20 people were killed in the series of ethnic violence in different districts of Manipur. However, local media quoting hospital sources said that at least 50 to 55 people, including women, have been killed in the attacks and counter attacks by the rival ethnic groups in at least six districts since May 3. “Over 100 people have been injured in these attacks. More than 500 houses, along with a large number of vehicles, shops and other properties were either burnt down or damaged in these attacks since May 3,” Singh told the media in Imphal on Saturday. He said that 23 police stations in different districts have been identified as most vulnerable and the Army and Central Armed Police Forces were adequately deployed in these areas. Flag marches by the Army and Assam Rifles are continuing in more than six districts, especially in the most volatile Churachandpur district, Singh said. In view of the prevailing unrest in Manipur, the Central government has already imposed Article 355 in the state to bring the situation under control. Article 355 is part of emergency provisions contained in the Constitution that empowers the Centre to take all necessary steps to protect a state against internal disturbances or external aggression."

The ship, commanded by Cdr Hemant V Salunkhe, was decommissioned at a sunset ceremony held at the Naval Base here. The Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern Naval Command (SNC), Vice Admiral, M A Hampiholi, who had helmed the ship from 2005-06, was the Chief Guest for the ceremony, Navy said. The ship’s timeline and a special postage cover was also released during the ceremony which was witnessed by dignitaries including senior personnel from the Armed forces, veterans and civil administration. Prior to the decommissioning ceremony, a “Barakhana” (wherein naval personnel enjoyed a special meal together) was organised by the ship in honour of erstwhile Commanding Officers, Officers and veterans who had served onboard the ship, Navy said in the release. INS Magar was launched on November 16, 1984 by Meera Tahiliani and commissioned on July 18, 1987 at Garden Reach Shipyard and Engineers Limited, Kolkata by late Admiral R H Tahiliani, Navy said. “During her service, she participated in numerous operations, amphibious exercises and humanitarian missions and operations including Samudra Setu wherein more than 4,000 Indian nationals were repatriated from various corners of the world, during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the release said. The ship was also instrumental in evacuation of over 1,300 survivors post Tsunami in 2004 and had been part of several joint military exercises with the Indian Army. In 2018, the vessel was converted into a training ship and joined the First Training Squadron at Kochi. As a precursor to the decommissioning, various outreach activities were conducted by the ship including a blood donation camp in collaboration with Indian Medical Association, Kochi on February 16. A cycle expedition was conducted from Kochi to Trivandrum from February 22 to 27 boosting jointmanship and synergy with 91 Infantry Brigade. Twenty sea warriors of the ship undertook a bike expedition from Pune to Kochi from March 27 to April 8 fostering a spirit of camaraderie with its affiliated Army Unit, the Bombay Sappers."
"“Papa, Please Come Back,” Says Daughter Of Soldier Killed In J&K Attack",https://idrw.org/papa-please-come-back-says-daughter-of-soldier-killed-in-jk-attack/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: PTI “Why are you not getting up? I don’t want anything, papa. Please come back,” 10-year-old Pawana Chib cried as she stretched out her hand to touch the face of her father, Havildar Neelam Singh, who lay in a coffin before her on Saturday. Standing next to her, Chib’s mother Vandana is staring in disbelief at her husband’s lifeless face held between her hands before she breaks down. The Havildar’s seven-year-old son Ankit is also inconsolable. Havildar Singh was among the five soldiers who died in an explosion triggered by terrorists on Friday in the thickly forested Kandi area in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district where an operation is underway to flush out terrorists. As Havildar Singh’s body reached his Dalpat-Chak Kripalpur village here in a Tricolour-wrapped coffin, some wept and others tried to make their way through a crowd of hundreds who had gathered to catch one last glimpse of the “brave son of soil”. The body was brought in a cavalcade from the Indian Air Force station in Jammu, where Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Northern Army Commander Lieutenant General Upendra Dwivedi, among other top Army, police and administration officials, paid homage to the soldier at a wreath-laying ceremony. Chants of “Neelam Singh Amar Rahe” echoed through the village as Vandana saluted her husband one last time. Havildar Singh was cremated with full military honours. His brother and CISF jawan Angad Singh lit his pyre amid chants of “Jai Shaheed, Jai Army, Jai Hind”. Recalling the last time Singh visited home, his father Hurdev Singh Chib said he is proud of his son. “I am proud of my son. He was a brave commando who laid down his life fighting terrorists. He was born a warrior. As a child, he always wanted to join the Army,” Hurdev told PTI. A few days ago, he had come home for a while, the distraught father recalled, adding, “He was so dutiful that he just had tea and left.” According to Hurdev, Singh was inducted into the Army in 2003. Havildar Singh’s father-in-law Captain Raghvir Singh Bhau (retd) echoed Hurdev’s sentiments. “He was brave and never feared anything. He was part of dozens of successful operations in various parts of Jammu and Kashmir. He brought laurels to the para unit and the Army,” he said. Havildar Singh’s cousin Suresh, however, was angry. “There is an attack every six months. How many homes will be destroyed? The forces retaliate and there will be a lull but then there will be another attack and another family will lose its son,” he said. Villagers described Havildar Singh as a helpful man. “I joined the armed forces just because Singh encouraged and helped me. I am indebted to him,” said a villager, Rameshwaram Singh. Another villager Sarita Devi recalled that Havildar Singh brought her medicines and other items whenever she was in need."
"In Joint Operation Of Forces, 1 Terrorist Killed, 1 Likely Injured In J&K",https://idrw.org/in-joint-operation-of-forces-1-terrorist-killed-1-likely-injured-in-jk/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: PTI A terrorist said to be part of the group that attacked civilians at Dhangri village earlier this year was killed during an operation on Saturday in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited an army base and took stock of the overall security situation, officials said. Another terrorist was believed to be injured in the early morning encounter in the Kesari hill of the forested Kandi area during ‘Operation Trinetra’ which was launched a day after five army personnel were killed and a major-rank officer injured when ultras triggered a blast targeting a search party in Kandi forest. “In the ongoing joint operation in Kandi forest, Rajouri sector, by Indian Army in coordination with Jammu and Kashmir Police and CRPF, at around 7 am, the cordon, while closing in, spotted and pinned down the terrorists. “In the ensuing gunbattle one terrorist has been neutralised and one terrorist is likely to be injured,” Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said. He said an AK-56 rifle, four magazines, 56 bullets, one 9-mm pistol, its three magazines and three grenades were seized from the terrorist whose identity and group affiliation were not known immediately. The People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a shadow organisation of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, has claimed responsibility for Friday’s attack. Officials said the search operation was extended to nearby areas with fresh reinforcements from the army and police moving in to block the escape routes. However, there was no fresh contact with the fleeing terrorist. Despite inclement weather, the operation is on, the officials said, adding the body of the terrorist was removed from the scene and his postmortem was also conducted. The officials said some people from Bathuni village, who were called for identification of the terrorist, said he was part of the group that was active in the area and believed to be behind the Dhangri attack on January 1, that left seven civilians dead and several others injured. Over the past 18 months, terrorists have killed 35 people, including 26 soldiers, in eight attacks in the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch. Defence Minister Singh, accompanied by Army chief General Manoj Pande and Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, reached the Ace of Spades Division headquarters in Rajouri in the afternoon after a brief stopover in Jammu. They also interacted with the troops engaged in the ongoing operation against terrorists, the officials said. Northern Army commander Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, the Corps Commander of White Knight Corps, and the Jammu Divisional Commissioner are also accompanying Rajnath to Rajouri, the officials said. After getting a brief on the operation in Kandi forest, the defence minister chaired a high-level security meeting to review the overall situation in Jammu and Kashmir, especially in Rajouri and Poonch before returning to Jammu, they said. Earlier in the day, Lt Gen Dwivedi visited the encounter site and was briefed about the developments in the ‘Operation Trinetra’. Rajouri and Poonch in Jammu, which were declared terrorism-free more than a decade ago, have been rocked by a series of deadly attacks since October 2021. The loss of five jawans in Kandi forest is the third major incident this year. It took place at a time when the forces are engaged in a massive combing operation for the past 15 days following an ambush on an army truck in Bhata Dhurian (Poonch). Five soldiers were killed and another was injured on April 20 when the army truck carrying fruits and vegetables for Iftar was bombed and strafed with bullets by terrorists. More than 250 people were detained for questioning during combing operations in the wake of the incident. Six overground workers who extended full support to terrorists were arrested, they said. According to military officials, terrorists now have adopted a strategy of engaging troops or attacking people and then laying improvised explosive devices to harm security forces engaged in combing operations. This also happened in Dhangri village in Rajouri where terrorists killed seven civilians in two attacks on January 1 this year. In two major incidents in Rajouri in 2022, five army personnel and two terrorists were killed in a suicide attack at a security camp at Pargal-Darhal on August 11, while two civilians were killed in a firing incident outside an army camp near Rajouri town. Besides the eight major attacks, four minor blasts rocked Kotranka in Rajouri district between March and April last year. All these cases were worked out by police with the arrest of the accused. Nine army personnel were killed in two separate encounters with terrorists in Bhatta Durrian in Mendhar tehsil of Poonch districts in October 2021. Two army personnel, one of them a lieutenant, were killed in a mine blast in Nowshera sector of Rajouri on October 30, 2021. Rajouri and Poonch districts have witnessed more killings of Army personnel than the militancy-hit Kashmir Valley."
Vietnam’s Buddhist monk seeks Indian support for peace outreach in Myanmar,https://idrw.org/vietnams-buddhist-monk-seeks-indian-support-for-peace-outreach-in-myanmar/,"May 7, 2023","SOURCE: IANS A celebrity monk from Vietnam revered globally and well known for his stellar role in the Nepal peace process has sought Indian support for his peace outreach in conflict-scarred Myanmar. Venerable Thay Huyen Dieu, popularly known as Dr Lam, told this writer this week that India should consider sending a high-level team to connect to all stakeholders in Myanmar for starting negotiations to bring back peace in the country. “I can accompany this team and be its religious adviser so that I can connect to top Burmese Buddhist religious figures who are revered by all including the military,” said Dr Lam in an interview at this writer’s residence. This appeal for a standalone Indian role comes at a time when a Track 1.5 meeting held in Delhi last week resulted in informal agreements for “all sides” to reduce violence, fight international crime, and accelerate aid delivery in Myanmar. The host, India, was joined by representatives from Myanmar’s junta, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. Japan was unable to attend because it was given an “extremely short notice”, a Japanese official told the outlet. The next meeting will reportedly be held in Laos, although no timeline was given. While those attending the conference agreed that the Track 1.5 dialogue would be “complementary” to ASEAN’s approach, India seems to have wrested the initiative away from Indonesia, the current ASEAN chair, which has claimed it’s pursuing “quiet diplomacy”, to little apparent effect so far. Speaking of controversial meetings, the group of retired global leaders The Elders issued a press release on Tuesday, defending their deputy chair – and former United Nations secretary general – Ban Ki-moon’s recent, and controversial, visit to Myanmar. The statement claimed that Ban met with “military leaders” and former president Thein Sein “to find a path to an end to violence and establishing a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and legitimate government”. The Elders said that Ban visited the country at the Tatmadaw’s invitation and that he said “the military must take the first steps” to resolving the conflict. “The religious element will be crucial in resolving the conflict in Myanmar. We don’t have to get into the political issues but focus on bringing back peace. Then India, the land of Gandhi, can take the initiative to settle political issues and restore democracy,” said Dr Lam. He recalled how his persistent efforts to connect to the Maoists in Nepal, despite the initial reluctance of Nepal Army and some royalists, helped in bringing the Maoists to the table. “I told Prachanda (Maoist supremo and now PM) that mindless bloodletting cannot go on in the land where the great Buddha was born. The persistence finally helped bring the Maoists to the table,” said Dr Lam, who runs two Vietnamese national Buddhist Temples in Lumbini (Nepal) and Bodh Gaya (India). Thay Huyen Dieu or Dr Lam is a renowned international spiritual leader born in Ben Tre Province, Vietnam. He embarked on the Buddhist monastic path at a young age. He eventually received a scholarship to study abroad in France and received his Ph.D from the University of Sorbonne (France). After teaching at universities and continuing doing “the Buddha’s work” in France, Venerable Huyen Dieu founded two Viet Nam Buddhist Monasteries in India and Nepal. Through many obstacles and challenges, he established the first Vietnamese temple in Bodhgaya, India, the sacred site where Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree. Under his leadership, he was also instrumental in working with the government of Nepal and Buddhist organisations and societies around the world in revitalizing the city of Lumbini, Nepal, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. His vision and leadership transformed Lumbini from a once deserted land into a thriving and more developed city of today. Venerable Huyen Dieu established the first Vietnamese temple in Lumbini and mobilized the development of over 20 additional Buddhist temples representing various countries in this sacred site. During the development of the temple in Lumbini, Nepal experienced a bloody civil war that resulted in over 14,000 deaths. Venerable Huyen Dieu was the key person in delivering a peaceful resolution ending this civil war. Venerable Huyen Dieu is currently the chairman of the International Buddhist Federation in Lumbini and the founder of two Viet Nam Phat Quoc Tu (Viet Nam Buddhist Monastery) in Bodhgaya, India and Lumbini, Nepal. Venerable Huyen Dieu has contributed immensely to the proliferation of Buddhism on a global scale. Dr Lam told this writer that “it was India’s destiny to emerge as the nerve centre for global peace diplomacy” which will redefine global politics in years to come. “Scientific and military muscle that Bigger Powers possess cannot end conflicts like those in Myanmar and Ukraine. You need peace diplomacy for that and only a country with the legacy of Buddha and Gandhi can talk reason to all sides involved in the conflict to put down their guns,” Dr Lam said. He said he will start his prayers for peace in Myanmar during the Buddha Jayanti in May at his temple in Lumbini. “I invite all including ambassadors to join the prayers,” he said."
Indian Army looking at BeiDou / GPS Jammers to thwart attack by Smart Weapons,https://idrw.org/indian-army-looking-at-beidou-gps-jammers-to-thwart-attack-by-smart-weapons/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: API Indian Army has been studying Russian usages of electronic jammers to interfere with GPS signals in Ukraine, particularly in the eastern regions where the conflict between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists has been ongoing. This has resulted in GPS-guided weapons, including US-made mobile rocket systems, being unable to accurately target their intended locations, leading to missed targets and potential civilian casualties. The use of electronic jammers is a common tactic in modern warfare and can be effective in disrupting enemy communications and navigation systems. According to a leaked Pentagon document, GPS jamming has the potential to interfere with other “smart” US munitions such as Excalibur artillery shells and JDAMs, which are precision-guided and air-dropped bombs. The document also mentioned that JDAMs are especially vulnerable to the disruptions caused by GPS jamming. Indian army believes that the acquisition of such jammers will enhance their ability to protect against GPS-guided attacks or jamming by adversaries, However, it is important to weigh the costs and potential downsides of using jammers, as they can also disrupt legitimate civilian GPS signals and create risks for friendly forces or civilians."
AIM-120D3: US is cranking up production of its next-generation air missile to beat China,https://idrw.org/aim-120d3-us-is-cranking-up-production-of-its-next-generation-air-missile-to-beat-china/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: API In recent years, there have been concerns about the aging AIM-120 missile, which has been the mainstay of the US air-to-air missile arsenal for BVR combat. The US Air Force had advertised the Raytheon AIM-120D3 Amraam missile as an upgrade for its obsolete two-decade-old electronics in the guidance section, but the rocket motor and propellant were not improved. However, Raytheon executives have claimed that the latest version of the 44-year-old radar-guided air-to-air missile program has set two new time-of-flight records in the past 15 months. Paul Ferraro, president of Air Power for Raytheon Missiles and Defense, mentioned in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow with Aviation Week that the extended time-of-flight demonstrated by the AIM-120D3 means that it has greater range than China’s radar-guided PL-15 missile. While the exact range of the domestic version of the PL-15 missile is not publicly available, its first public appearance in 2015 caused the US Air Force to initiate a new air-to-air missile program for the first time since the 1970s. In 2017, the Air Force secretly selected Lockheed Martin to develop the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), which one top officer said in 2019 formed the service’s response to the threat posed by the PL-15. The recent flight tests of the AIM-120D3 with the F3R upgrades have demonstrated an extended range due to the longer battery life. Further optimization of the missile’s performance against future targets is expected with the upcoming SIP-4F software release. However, it is difficult to compare the AIM-120D3’s current performance against the AIM-260 program’s goals since the range of the potential threat posed by the PL-15 missile is shrouded in mystery. While China has advertised that the export version of the PL-15 has a range of 78 n.m., this may not reflect the full capabilities of the domestic version. Additionally, the range of any air-to-air missile is dependent on the speed and altitude of the launch aircraft. Although few details are publicly available about the AIM-260 program, it was initially scheduled for fielding on the Lockheed Martin F-22 this year and on the Boeing F/A-18E/F next year, according to Air Force officials in June 2019. However, there have been no updates on the schedule since then, despite repeated requests for information. An Air Force spokeswoman confirmed that the AIM-260 will augment the AIM-120 and is necessary to counter adversary air threat investments."

Nasir Seikh, a resident of Brahmanagar in Chapra police station area, entered the Bangladeshi territory by mistake while working on farmland, and was apprehended by the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), they said. Many areas at the international border between the two countries do not have fencing, and people of both sides often crossover into each other’s territory unintentionally, they added. Seikh said he was handed over to the police by the BGB and subsequently produced before a court, which sent him to jail for 2 months. However, due to several complications, he had to remain there for around 15 months and could only return home after the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh intervened. He was handed over to the BSF by the BGB at the Gede check post. His brother Siraj Seikh went to the check post along with a local panchayat member to receive him. “I am feeling good that I could return home after 15 months. I received good behaviour during my stay in Bangladesh,” he said. He has four children, while his wife died about seven years back. His brother Siraj said, “Nasir is the eldest of our seven brothers. He used to work as a farm labourer. He has three sons and a daughter, who have been living like orphans after his arrest. We are happy for his return.”"

The incident occurred while Panjwar was walking near his residence in the Sunflower Society of Johar Town, accompanied by his personal gunman. The assailants, riding a motorcycle, attacked and killed Panjwar, while his gunman sustained injuries and was taken to the hospital for medical attention. The KCF was responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in Punjab during the 1980s and 1990s, including the bombing of a passenger train in 1995 that killed 68 people. Panjwar was the chief of the KCF from 1986 until his death, and was wanted by Indian authorities for a number of crimes, including murder, kidnapping and extortion. The Indian government has long accused Pakistan of supporting separatist groups in Punjab and other parts of India. In recent years, however, there have been signs of a thaw in relations between the two countries, with both sides taking steps to improve trade and people-to-people contacts. The killing of Panjwar is likely to be seen as a positive step by the Indian government, which has been calling on Pakistan to crack down on terrorist groups operating on its soil."

Russia Says It Has Billions of Indian Rupees That It Can’t Use,https://idrw.org/russia-says-it-has-billions-of-indian-rupees-that-it-cant-use/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: BLOOMBERG Russia has accumulated billions of rupees in Indian banks which it can’t use, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday, pointing to a ballooning trade surplus with the South Asian nation. “This is a problem,” Lavrov told reporters in India’s western state of Goa on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. “We need to use this money. But for this, these rupees must be transferred in another currency, and this is being discussed now.” India’s total exports to Russia shrunk 11.6% to $2.8 billion in the first 11 months of the 2022-23 financial year, while imports rose nearly fivefold to $41.56 billion, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. That surge came as Indian refiners have scooped up discounted Russian oil in the past year that’s been shunned by the West in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Imports of Russian crude by India reached a record 1.68 million barrels a day in April, up sixfold on a year earlier, according to Vortexa Ltd, a data intelligence firm. The Kremlin initially encouraged India to trade in national currencies following sanctions on Russian banks and a ban on transactions using the SWIFT messaging system. But volatility in the ruble soon after the war began meant plans for a rupee-ruble mechanism for oil imports were abandoned. India has resisted pressure from the US to scale back relations with Moscow since the invasion of Ukraine. ‘Frozen Funds’ The imbalance in trade for Russia means “the volume of ‘frozen funds’ can reach tens of billions of dollars,” said Alexander Knobel, director of the Institute of International Economics and Finance of the Ministry of Economic Development. “The situation is aggravated by India’s historically high aggregate trade deficit, which reduces the possibilities of clearing settlements with third countries.” Russia is India’s largest supplier of weapons and military hardware, though defense supplies to the South Asian nation have stalled for lack of a payment mechanism that doesn’t violate US sanctions. Indian payments for weapons amounting to more than $2 billion have been stuck for about a year as New Delhi has been unable to settle the bill in dollars because of concerns about falling foul of secondary sanctions, while Russia is reluctant to accept rupees for purchases. Indian oil refiners have been trying to settle payments for discounted crude using United Arab Emirates dirhams, rubles and rupees. Trades can be exempted from international restrictions if they are priced below the $60-a-barrel price cap set by the Group of Seven nations and their European Union partners. Indian lenders opened special vostro accounts at Russian banks including Sberbank PJSC and VTB Bank PJSC to facilitate overseas trade in rupees and keep crude flowing. Currency restrictions mean Russian exporters face difficulty in repatriating rupees, Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on April 28."

Qin met in India on Thursday with other foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a bloc of nations spanning most of Eurasia, with Beijing seeking to preserve stable relations with countries in the region as ties with the West, particularly Washington, remain tense. The United States has long urged China to help resolve the war in Ukraine even though Beijing has refused to denounce Russia’s military moves as an invasion. In a landmark move last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke directly with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time since Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine. During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the SCO meeting, Qin said China is “willing to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to make tangible contributions to the political settlement of the crisis” in Ukraine. The two sides also agreed to strengthen communication and coordination with other SCO member-states and maintain the bloc’s “unity”, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday. They additionally agreed to strengthen coordination in the Asia-Pacific, the ministry said, without giving details. Currently the bloc includes Russia, India, China, Pakistan and four Central Asian countries – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Iran and Belarus are expected to be inducted into the SCO at a summit in New Delhi in July, an Indian foreign ministry official said. In a separate meeting with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Qin said China is willing to deepen “coordination and cooperation” on international and regional issues with India and bring ties back to a “healthy” track of development. China’s ties with India have deteriorated since 2020, when their troops clashed on a disputed Himalayan border and 24 people were killed. Last month, Beijing published a map showing Arunachal Pradesh, claimed by India, as part of Tibet, angering New Delhi. Qin told Jaishankar that the situation on the border is “generally stable”. “We should draw experience and lessons from history, grasp bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, respect each other, learn from each other, and achieve mutual success,” Qin told Jaishankar."
Pakistan-India talks hurt by Delhi’s decision to end Kashmir special status: Pakistan foreign minister,https://idrw.org/pakistan-india-talks-hurt-by-delhis-decision-to-end-kashmir-special-status-pakistan-foreign-minister/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: REUTERS Pakistan’s foreign minister on Friday said India’s decision to end the special status of Jammu & Kashmir territory in 2019 has undermined the environment for holding talks between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Kashmir is claimed in full but ruled in part by the two who have fought two of their three wars over control of the region. The special status given to the Indian side was revoked in 2019 when the Indian government split it into two federally controlled territories. Pakistan calls the moves illegal. “The onus is on India to create a conducive environment for talks,” Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional bloc in the Indian state of Goa. Bhutto-Zardari’s visit to India is the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Delhi in over a decade and has garnered a lot of media attention in both countries. The two share frosty relations and have downgraded their diplomatic ties. The Pakistani foreign minister said that, despite his rare visit to India, there was no change in the status of diplomatic relations. But he added that politics and foreign policy should not hold “hostage” sporting ties between the rivals. Historically, cricket, wildly popular on both sides of the border, has been the strongest basis of ties. But there remain doubts over whether the Pakistani team would travel to India for the cricket World Cup later this year. “I hope we’re in a position to not have sports suffer as a result of foreign policy,” Bhutto-Zardari said when asked if Pakistan would send its team to India for the event. Pakistan last played in India in 2016, while India have not visited Pakistan since 2008."

Jaishankar mounted an offensive against Bhutto-Zardari in his address at the SCO meeting, contending Pakistan foreign minister’s statement that terrorism shouldn’t be “weaponised for diplomatic point-scoring”, in remarks seen as directed at India. Hours later at a press conference, Jaishankar said Bhutto-Zardari’s statement on the weaponisation of terrorism unconsciously revealed a mindset. “As a foreign minister of an SCO member state, Bhutto-Zardari was treated accordingly. As a promoter, justifier and a spokesperson of a terrorism industry, which is the mainstay of Pakistan, his positions were called out and they were countered including at the SCO meeting itself,” Jaishankar said. Responding to a question about talks with India, Bhutto-Zardari said that Pakistan was clear that India should create a conducive environment for talks by restoring the pre-August 5, 2019 status of Kashmir. He also said that countries from Central Asia were looking forward to becoming part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. He said every country except India supported and praised CPEC.

India To Build Massive Observatory ‘LIGO’ To Detect Gravitational Waves,https://idrw.org/india-to-build-massive-observatory-ligo-to-detect-gravitational-waves/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory or LIGO-India will significantly enhance scientists’ ability to pinpoint the sources of gravitational waves — ripples in the fabric of space and time — and answer fundamental questions about the universe, experts say. The Union Cabinet recently approved the construction of LIGO-India, a 2,600 crore rupee project, in the Hingoli district of Maharashtra that is expected to begin observations by the end of the decade. Experts say that LIGO-India’s location relative to the other two Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO detectors in the US and other gravitational wave detectors around the world will help lend accuracy and precision to gravitational waves’ observation and detection. The purpose of LIGO detectors, and other gravitational wave (GW) detectors around the world, is to localise the source of gravitational waves. “(Precisely localising the source) is very important for pointing electromagnetic telescopes to the corresponding patch of sky and look for possible electromagnetic signatures, if present,” said K. G. Arun, who is part of the LIGO-India Scientific Collaboration (LISC). “This can be achieved only if we have a geographically well-separated global network of detectors and LIGO-India will be extremely crucial for this,” Arun, also professor of Physics, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Tamil Nadu, told Press Trust of India. Localisation of the source in the sky relies on the technique of triangulation, widely used in global positioning system (GPS) navigation. It is the method of determining the position of a fixed point from the angles to it from two fixed points of a known distance apart, using trigonometry. The method works by calculating the relative delays in GW signal arrival times in multiple detectors. “Because the detectors are separated by a distance, there is a delay in the arrival time of the signal at the two detectors for a given source, typically milliseconds. This is simply because GWs take slightly more or less time to reach one detector compared to the other. “This difference changes for different positions in the sky and, therefore, gives us an idea of which part of the sky the signal has come from. This is how the source in the sky is located,” explained Arun. It is basically the same principle that is used to find our location by accounting for the delays in receiving signals from three or more GPS satellites, said Sanjit Mitra, Professor and LIGO-India Project Coordinator at Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. When the detectors are placed far away, a small change in the direction of the signal source can create significant delays in the signal arrival times, helping in precise sky localisation. The two US detectors, one in Hanford in eastern Washington and the other in Livingston, Louisiana, are about 3,000 kilometres apart, termed as the baseline distance. “The inclusion of LIGO-India will create two more baselines with distances over 10,000 kms each. This will improve sky localisation by many folds,” Mitra told PTI over the phone. Further, to practically realise sky localisation, all the three detectors must have similar sensitivities. LIGO-India will have the same sensitivity as the two other LIGO detectors. Sensitivity of the detector, which is basically an interferometer, is described by how responsive it is to tiny length changes in its arm lengths, introduced when a gravitational wave is incident on it. “The interferometer is initially locked into a dark fringe mode, achieved by tuning the arm lengths to make sure there is destructive interference of light,” explained Arun. Destructive interference leads to a smaller or no resultant wave when two out-of-sync waves are combined, thereby producing a ‘dark fringe’ or no light as output. “(The incidence of the gravitational wave) shifts the interferometer from dark fringe mode and you detect some light as output,” explained Arun. “The smallest change in the time taken by light to navigate the interferometer’s arms leads to a change in the instrument’s ‘fringe pattern’. This is how an interferometer gets sensitive to the effect of incident gravitational waves,” said Mitra. The displacement that LIGO measures due to a passing GW is 1/1000ths of the size of an atomic nucleus, which is extremely small. “In practice, the sensitivity of the interferometer depends on the frequency of the incoming waves,” said Mitra. This is because challenges to detect waves can stem from all that can generate “noise” in an interferometer. They can be due to low frequency seismic waves generated partly by human activities. They could also come from molecules surrounding us, which vibrate from the ambient heat. All this “noise” could significantly impact the performance of LIGO detectors. “One can quantify the typical noise levels in the detector. A signal has to be well-above these levels to be confidently detected,” said Arun. Effective noise suppression also governs the distance up to which these waves can be detected in the sky by the interferometer. Further, heavier the mass system of the source, larger the distances they can be observed to. “The present generation interferometers, such as LIGO, can detect GWs originating from a distance that is several billions of light years. Future upgrades could improve it by roughly 10 fold,” said Arun. LIGO-India, which makes use of the same technology as the US detectors, is capable of being as sensitive as the LIGO detectors of the US at the time of operating. Each gravitational wave observatory is essentially one large highly sophisticated interferometer.Eventually, the objective is to have a worldwide network of gravitational waves detectors, the physicists said."

Also coming down hard on the neighbouring country over its falling global standing, the External Affairs Minister said, “Pakistan’s credibility is depleting faster than its forex reserves.” Rebutting Bhutto’s comment on the upcoming G20 conference in Srinagar, Jaishankar further said, “Pakistan has nothing to do with G20 and also not with Srinagar. ” Meanwhile, the spectre of terrorism surfaced again in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday, with the Army engaged in a fierce standoff with Pakistan-backed terrorists in the Rajouri district. The gunbattle broke out on a day Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was in Goa to take part in the SCO meet. Five soldiers lost their lives in the anti-terror operation in the Kandi area of Rajouri on Thursday. “Victims of terrorism do not sit together with perpetrators of terrorism to discuss terrorism. Victims of terrorism defend themselves, counter acts of terrorism, they call it out, they legitimise it and that is exactly what is happening. To come here and preach these hypocritical words as though we are on the same boat,” Jaishankar said, hitting out at Pakistan. Jaishankar said ‘victims of terrorism’ fight terrorism. Responding to a question from a Pakistani journalist on whether a visit by the foreign minister of the neighbouring country after a long time will help normalise relations with India, the EAM said “India and Pakistan are not on the same boat”."
"Battlefield surveillance system to situational awareness module, Army working on number of key projects to transform itself: Sources",https://idrw.org/battlefield-surveillance-system-to-situational-awareness-module-army-working-on-number-of-key-projects-to-transform-itself-sources/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: PTI The Indian Army is working on a number of key tech-driven projects, including a battlefield surveillance system and another initiative that will bring in “multi-domain spatial awareness” on a single GIS platform to make itself more potent and efficient, sources said. The Army is observing 2023 as the ‘Year of Transformation’ and these projects aim to “reshape and re-engineer” the functional processes and bring in a “quantum jump” in its capabilities, they said. Among these projects is the Army’s Battlefield Surveillance System or ‘Project Sanjay’ which seeks to create a number of surveillance centres for the field formations. ‘Project Sanjay’ will enable the integration of a “large number of sensors” and a provision to enable an integrated surveillance picture to commanders and staff at all levels, “besides completing the sensor-shooter grid by integrating it with the ACCCS (Artillery Combat Command and Control and Communication System)”, sources in the defence establishment said. The ambitious project has “come of age” with the completion of “extensive validation” carried out in multiple terrains over a “protracted period”, they said. The trials were conducted in plains, desert areas, and finally in mountainous terrain during August-October last year, a source said. BEL Ghaziabad is the project’s system integrator, and they have succeeded in meeting the Army’s aspiration in full. The contract with the supplier is now being progressed further for delivery of these surveillance centres for the field formations by December 2025, he said. Army Chief Manoj Pande, during an interaction at an event held here recently, spoke about the transformation steps taken by the Army going forward, adding that it has laid down five domains in which this transformation will take place in the future. “We have taken a number of transformation initiatives so that we become a more modern, more technology-driven, self-reliant and a battle-worthy force to be able to not only carry out our mandate more effectively, but also to be able to meet future security challenges in a more effective manner,” he said. Sources in the defence establishment said the Army is observing the year of transformation to set itself on a course to become a “future-ready, technology-driven, lethal and agile force”, which establishes itself as an “iron cast pillar of national power”. The other key project the Army is working on is SAMA (Situational Awareness Module for the Army). The Army’s Combat Information Decision Support System (CIDSS) has been re-designed as the Army Information and Decision Support System (AIDSS), which will integrate inputs from all operational and managerial information systems. The in-house decision support system which has been developed is called SAMA, the sources said. The SAMA has been developed in conjunction with BISAG-N and has successfully integrated inputs from ACCCS and three other platforms. The application has been designed to present a “comprehensive battlefield picture” to commanders at all levels based on authorisation and roles. SAMA is being fielded this month for field validation in a corps zone, the source said. The sources said the transformation envisaged in the force is in sync with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, and its endeavour to be a “net centric force” through the infusion of technology. “Our aspirations today are aligning with realities that exist in the country today,” the source said. The other key projects include E-Sitrep (Situational Reporting Over Enterprise-Class GIS Platform), ‘Project Avgat’ (Army’s Own Gati Shakti), and ‘Project Anumaan’ on meteorological data, the sources said. Situational reporting is the keystone of all operational correspondence that happens on a perpetual basis, and this is the lifeblood that keeps the operational staff working. This workflow has matured over the years, however over the last few months it has undergone a “major transformation,” they said. “Commencing June this year, the situational reporting would start happening on an enterprise-class geographic information system platform configured for the Army’s operational needs, with a state-of-the-art spatial visualisation, temporal and dynamic querying and analytics custom-built for commanders and staff as per authorisation rules. The system will be first operationalised in Army’s Northern Command in June 2023 and the balance Commands will migrate to the new system later,” the source said. On ‘Project Avgat’, the sources said, “inspired by the PM Gati Shakti”, the Army has emulated the platform’s design and has begun its own initiative to build a similar project that will bring in “multi domain spatial awareness on a single GIS platform”. The concept will be operationalised in a “phased manner” and in the first phase the project will bring together inputs from the operational domain, logistic inputs of selected nature, satellite imagery data, topographic and meteorological inputs on a common platform and “the system is expected to be fully operational towards the year-end”, they said. PM Gati Shaki is designed as a national master plan for multi-modal connectivity, a digital platform to bring 16 ministries together for integrated planning and coordinated implementation of infrastructure connectivity projects. For ‘Project Anumaan’, the Army has entered into a partnership with the National Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), with an MoU signed in November last year. The Army will help NCMRWF with the collection of observations along northern borders and will receive in the near future customised products for higher resolution weather forecasts for its components along the northern borders, the sources said. On ‘Project INDRA’, they said, the application has been developed to manage a database of Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and other personnel which are spread across 47 Record Offices, corresponding to regiments, arms and services. INDRA stands for Indian Army Data Repository and Analytics. The application enables the collection, compilation and extraction of data and information for statistical analysis to various stakeholders, as per their role and charter. “The compilation of data for statistical and analysis purposes became a challenge. A central data repository has already been created at the IHQ of MoD (Army) in June 2022,” the source said. On ASAAN (Army Software for Agnipath Administration and Networking), the sources said, the application is currently in use with effect from January 1, 2023, for the first batch of Agniveers who have joined the training centres. Also, with the introduction of e-office, the use of digital signatures in day-to-day correspondence has increased from near zero in October 2022 to several thousand every month in 2023, they said. This is part of the Army’s efforts to go paperless in its working and improve efficiency, another source said. “Proliferation of digital signing helps both e-office and paperless office objectives. Since October 28, all officials in DGIS (Directorate General Information Systems) are only signing digitally, and have found no difficulty in migration from ink signatures,” he said. “Now it’s becoming trendy, and a dozen directorates are trying to emulate,” the source said."
IRGC to build aircraft carrier,https://idrw.org/irgc-to-build-aircraft-carrier/,"May 6, 2023","SOURCE: TEHRAN TIMES Alireza Tangsiri, who is the chief of the IRGC Navy, said the aircraft in question will be developed by Iran for the first time in the world. “In the future, we will see an aircraft carrier that does not exist in the world,” he said, according to Iranian media. “This carrier has both the ability to carry aircraft and the ability to carry a number of missile-launching boats inside it, which has no equivalent in the world.” According to General Tangsiri, the Shahid Mahdavi and Shahid Rodaki vessels are a successful experience of entering this field and building vessels to improve the ability to sail for a long time, and “you will see newer generations of vessels with more capabilities in the future”. He said, “The IRGC Navy was formed with a set of rocket-launching boats, but today it is equipped with a variety of equipment in the field of missiles, buoyancy, drones, etc., all of which are domestically manufactured. Every day, the process of upgrading this equipment is being followed more carefully, so that the IRGC Navy’s rocket-launching vessels are now equipped with precision-guided missiles.” General Aziz Nasirzadeh, deputy chairman of the chiefs of staff of the Iranian armed forces, announced on Wednesday that plans are afoot to hold joint military exercises between the Army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. He said the IRGC and the Army are not separated entities. “Each of these two forces performs different assigned missions and we have passed the issue that a person is a member of the IRGC, the army or a member of another corps.” The brigadier general added, “The policies of the chiefs of staff of the armed forces are on the same lines, and the commanders of the Army and the IRGC also follow the same line. In fact, there is a strong alliance between the armed forces. And the Army and the IRGC are a divine army that operates under the banner of the Leader of the Revolution.” He considered the unity of the armed forces as the reason for the strength of Iran’s deterrence power. “We have seen that guests from both sides participated in Army or IRGC exercises, but the plan is based on planning and defining exercises jointly with the presence of the Army and the IRGC. This will be done in the future with the participation of units from both sides. Of course, we witnessed that in the joint exercise that was conducted with the presence of Iran, Russia and China, our navy was composed of the Army and the IRGC,” he continued. During coordinated naval exercises in the northern Indian Ocean, the armed forces of Iran, China, and Russia have conducted a variety of tactics and operations, including rescuing hijacked vessels. In March, the Iranian, Chinese, and Russian navies participated in the major stage of the 2023 Maritime Security Belt naval drills in the northern Indian Ocean."

Addressing a press conference at the conclusion of the Foriegn Ministers’ Meeting under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), S Jaishankar was asked to share details about his talks with Chinese Foriegn Minister Qin Gang. To this, the EAM replied, “The issue is that there is an abnormal position in the border areas, along the boundary. We had a very frank discussion about it…We have to take the disengagement process forward.” “I have made it very clear, publically as well, that India-China relations are not normal and cannot be normal if peace and tranquillity in the border areas are disturbed…” Jaishankar added. “I have been very consistent about it and I have not changed my position in this meeting either,” he added. Regarding the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Jaishankar said, “It was made very clear twice that connectivity is good for progress but it cannot violate the integrity and sovereignty of states.” “This has been our long-standing position and nobody should have any doubt about it and I assure you nobody in this room has any doubt about it. I made sure of that,” Jaishanakar added. China’s CPEC projects in Pakistan have slowed down due to the prevailing economic crisis in the neighbouring country. Pakistan has been slow to complete infrastructure projects and China has been slow to fund new ones, reported Foreign Policy. Citing a case in point, the report said a reactor that was inaugurated by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in February was funded by China to strengthen Pakistan’s energy security. The work on the reactor began in 2016 after the launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The slowing pace of the CPEC projects is not only because of the ongoing economic crisis in Pakistan as it cannot afford the infrastructure loans extended to it, but also due to Beijing’s own economic slowdown."

There is only one issue to discuss on Kashmir which is when does Pakistan vacate its illegal occupation of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir,” the EAM added. On a question on abrogation of Article 370, EAM Dr S Jaishankar phrased, “…wake up and smell the coffee. 370 is history. The sooner people realise it, the better it is.” Over the visit of Pakistan Foreign Minister Bhutto to Goa for the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers in Goa, EAM slammed his neighbouring counterpart, saying, “He came here as the Foreign Minister of an SCO Member State. That is part of multilateral diplomacy. Don’t see it as anything more than that. I think that nothing from what he said or what I heard he said deserves for this to be treated more than that.”"

The scientist was earlier arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) for leaking sensitive information through apps to foreign agents who had honey trapped him. “The scientist had been removed as the Laboratory Director after our probe found that he was found indulging in leaking sensitive information,” a senior DRDO official told ANI. “The agency had launched a probe against Purulkar after receiving inputs from other agencies about his activities online,” he added. “He had been attached to some office and we had already taken action against him,” the official added. Officials said the agency is still carrying out an investigation into the issue and also sensitising its officials against indulging in any such activities on social media. Kurulkar was an ‘Outstanding Scientist’ (equivalent to Lieutenant General in Army) while heading the Research & Development Establishment (Engineers) laboratory in Pune as its director. Responding to the development, Maharashtra ATS said the scientist was found to have had contact with the operatives of Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI through social media via WhatsApp messages, voice calls, and video. The ATS said despite holding a responsible position, the scientist allegedly misused his post, thereby compromising on sensitive government secrets, which could pose a threat to national security if it falls into the hands of the enemy nation. A case has been filed against the scientist under Section 1923 of the Official Secrets Act 1923 and other relevant sections."

The STFE is a compact and lightweight gas turbine engine that is designed to provide high thrust output while remaining fuel-efficient. The STFE is a two-stage turbofan engine that uses a single shaft to drive both the compressor and the fan. It has a bypass ratio of 0.3:1, which means that 70% of the air that enters the engine is used for combustion and 30% is bypassed around the combustion chamber to provide additional thrust. The engine is designed to produce a maximum thrust of 450 kgf (990 pounds). The inclusion of the STFE in the LRLACM system will significantly enhance India’s defense capabilities, particularly in the area of long-range land attack. The imminent orders for the STFE from GTRE will further strengthen Godrej Aerospace’s position as a key player in the Indian aerospace industry and contribute to the country’s indigenous manufacturing capabilities."
Focus back on ALH-Dhruv after fresh Crash,https://idrw.org/focus-back-on-alh-dhruv-after-fresh-crash/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: API The recent crash of an Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) near Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir has raised concerns about the metallurgical issues with a critical component on board – the control rod. This incident has led to a team of three armed forces personnel consulting with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) regarding the need to replace the control rod, which is a key component in transferring power from the two engines of the copter to its overhead rotors. The control rod in question is made of aluminium, which the armed forces have suggested replacing with a stronger material such as steel. Special checks are already in place to inspect the control rod after every 100 hours of flying. The failure of control in the gearbox due to the control rod can result in the helicopter not responding correctly to the pilot’s inputs. This can lead to a loss of control of the helicopter, making it impossible to maneuver, as pilots have reported sudden loss of power while flying ALHs. Thursday’s incident was the tenth involving a crash or an emergency landing in the past three years, since May 2020. This is the third such incident in the past two months alone, and it is causing concern among the authorities. Currently, 284 ALH variants are in operation, and the repeated incidents of malfunctioning have raised serious questions about the helicopter’s safety. The issue with the control rod is not new, and the armed forces have been in discussion with HAL for some time now regarding the replacement of the control rod with a stronger material. However, the recent spate of incidents has brought the issue to the forefront again, and urgent action needs to be taken to prevent further incidents. The ALH is a vital component of India’s defense capabilities, and it is imperative that the issue with the control rod is resolved as soon as possible. The repeated incidents of crashes and emergency landings are a cause for concern, and the safety of the pilots and crew must be given utmost priority. In conclusion, the issue with the control rod in the ALH is a cause for concern and needs urgent attention. The armed forces have suggested replacing the control rod with a stronger material, and HAL must take immediate action to address this issue. The repeated incidents of crashes and emergency landings are a serious matter and must be resolved to ensure the safety of the pilots and crew operating the ALH."
"India-China border stable, both sides should push for further cooling: Chinese FM to Jaishankar",https://idrw.org/india-china-border-stable-both-sides-should-push-for-further-cooling-chinese-fm-to-jaishankar/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: pti Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang reiterated that the situation at the India-China border is generally stable and both sides should consolidate the present achievements and strictly abide by the relevant agreements while pushing for further cooling and easing of the conditions for sustainable peace and tranquillity at the frontier. In his talks with External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar at Benaulim in Goa on the sidelines of the SCO Foreign Ministers on Thursday, Qin restated China’s oft-repeated recent stance that the current situation on the China-India border is generally stable, in an apparent reference to the ongoing military standoff in Eastern Ladakh which brought the relations to standstill. Qin said the two sides should continue to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, consolidate the existing achievements, strictly abide by relevant agreements, push for further cooling and easing of the border situation and maintain sustainable peace and tranquillity in the border areas, a press release on Qin-Jaishankar talks issued here on Friday said. In a tweet after the talks, Jaishankar said the focus remained on resolving outstanding issues and ensuring peace and tranquillity in the border areas. “A detailed discussion with State Councillor and FM Qin Gang of China on our bilateral relationship. Focus remains on resolving outstanding issues and ensuring peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” he said. Jaishankar said the discussions were also held on issues relating to the SCO, G20 and BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa). Qin maintained that China and India, as the two most populous developing countries in the world, are both in a critical period of modernisation. He said we should draw lessons from history, approach the bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, respect, learn from and make achievements from each other, and embark on a new path of harmonious coexistence, peaceful development and common rejuvenation among major neighbours, so as to lend impetus to national rejuvenation and inject stability and positive energy into world peace and development China is ready to work with India to carry out bilateral consultations and exchanges, enhance dialogue and cooperation under multilateral frameworks, deepen coordination and cooperation on international and regional issues and bring China-India relations back to the track of sound and stable development. Qin Gang said China supports India in hosting a successful SCO summit and hopes that India, as the rotating chair, will play a positive role for the success of the summit in the spirit of unity and coordination. The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern, the press release added. Last week, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart Li Shangfu at a meeting that China’s violation of existing border agreements “eroded” the entire basis of ties between the two countries and that all issues relating to the frontier must be resolved in accordance with the existing pacts. The meeting on April 27 took place in New Delhi on the sidelines of a conclave of the SCO defence ministers. Days ahead of the meeting between the two defence ministers, the Indian and Chinese armies held 18th round of talks on ending the border row. In the Corps Commander talks on April 23, the two sides agreed to stay in close touch and work out a mutually acceptable solution to the remaining issues in eastern Ladakh at the earliest. However, there was no indication of any clear forward movement in ending the three-year row. The ties between India and China nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. The Indian and the Chinese troops are locked in a standoff at a few friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh for the last three years though they disengaged in several places following a series of military and diplomatic talks. India has been maintaining that the relationship between the two countries should be based on “three mutuals” mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests. The eastern Ladakh border standoff erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake area. As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in 2021 on the north and south banks of the Pangong Lake and in the Gogra area"
"OPINION : India Must Build Many XLUUVs to Protect SSBNs,CBGs, and Indian Ocean",https://idrw.org/opinion-india-must-build-many-xluuvs-to-protect-ssbnscbgs-and-indian-ocean/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: JOYDEEP GHOSH/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG India’s MoD has initiated a project to design and develop Extra Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (XLUUV) for Indian Navy to bridge glaring gap in its underwater capabilities due to significant delays to Project-75I. As per reports Indian Navy needs up to 12 XLUUVs. But I would say India must operate at least2 dozen (24) XLUUVs with an endurance of at least 75 days. The XLUUV may reportedly have a maximum ‘length with payload’ of up to 50 meters, width of up to 5 meters, height no more than 10 meters and gross weight without ballast under 300 tons making it one of the largest submarine drones at par with Germany’s Modifiable Underwater Mothership, US Navy’s Orca XLUUV and Russia’s Sarma-D, that are in the prototyping phase. The XLUUV is intended for ISR, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and mine warfare. An external payload of up to 10 tons by mounting two 533 mm torpedo tubes and mine laying capability for the XLUUVS is being considered. 8 smaller High Endurance Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (HEAUV) are also planned for anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasure operations but they will only complement the XLUUVs. Autonomous features are a key requirement of XLUUVs that are to be deployed from a pier, conduct operations in shallow and restricted waters and return to harbour on its own. It must be capable of being transported by motherships and trailers on land. However, I sincerely hope that XLUUVs must also be configured to operate in deep waters of ocean long wayaway from coasts autonomously. Why, simply because with a submerged maximum speed of at least 8 knots and cruising speed of 4 knots with endurance of over 45 days using Li-Po/Li-ion batteries or DRDO’s Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) as power source with diesel generator to recharge batteries; it is a bad idea that such a platform will only be used in shallow waters. These features practically make the XLUUVs an unmanned submarine ideally suited for deepwater long endurance missions. So, what are the uses of XLUUVs in deep water missions, here is the probable list. 1. Protect SSBNs The world over whoever operates an SSBN the ideal component of a SSBN on patrol are 2 SSNs that guard its rear and front. As is known India doesn’t have an operational SSN, the Project 78 is likely to build only 3 SSNs. INS Chakra II, was operated by Indian Navy as a SSN but as it was leased so lacked offensive weapon. Even if the P78 materialize India will be always be handicapped to protect the SSBNs with just 1 SSN for each SSBN. If Indian Navy uses 1 or 2 XLUUVs along with a single SSN to protect a SSBN, it will give all round protection to the SSBNs whenever they go out on patrol. 2. Protect CBGs A CBG or Carrier Battle Group is centred around an aircraft carrier, which operates alongside a fleet of destroyers, frigates, supply ships, amphibious assault ship,oilers, missile boats, and at least 2 submarines. Whenever a CBG is on the move, not many will know but it patrols only up to that area till where the CBG is provided cover by submarines. USA that operates 11 nuke powered aircraft carriers and 11 carrier battle groups operates them anywhere in the world since these CBGs are covered by 2 SSNs that in itself have unlimited range. Operating 2 SSNs with a CBG is a luxury Indian Navy can’t afford. At best it can operate 2 SSKs with a CBG but that will limit the range of CBG it can operate since the SSKs have a maximum of 45-day endurance and even with AIP a SSK will have 60-day endurance, meaning a CBG of INS Vikrant or INS Vikramaditya can operate only till that area till the SSKs can provide cover. If Indian Navy operates 2 or 3 XLUUVs along with a SSK to cover a CBG, then a CBG can operate till far as the endurance of XLUUVs exists. 3. Protect/Patrol Indian Ocean Many don’t know that Indian Navy since 1947 wanted 4 aircraft carriers with 3 always operational, mainly to patrol and protect the vast Indian Ocean till its southern limits. But CCS/MoD didn’t approve of the plan and as such Indian Navy is unlikely to ever have 3 operational aircraft carriers together, mainly due to financial reasons. This has basically limited the scope of operational patrol of Indian Navy only in the northern Indian Ocean, where as southern half of the Indian Ocean remains unprotected. Even with P8i or MQ9B Predator drones only till Madagascar and southern end of Sumatra will be covered. This is a big gap that needs to be filled, and XLUUVs can greatly help patrol/protect the southern part of Indian Ocean. Why I say it is important as many may not know but the fact is that China has been steadily increasing its illegal fishing in the southern part of Indian Ocean. China operates dozens of fully mechanized fishing ships (not trawlers) that drag vast nets stretching several hundred yards, that basically pick up the entire shoal/school of fishes leaving very little to reach up to the northern Indian Ocean. As such, fact is fisher folk in India have seen a steady decline in their catch that has been compounded by climate change. If XLUUVs are used to protect/patrol the areas of Indian Ocean where constant patrol by P8i or MQ9B Predator drones is not possible, then may be a lot of fishes can be saved from illegal fishing of Chinese ships. I sincerely hope Indian Navy doesn’t just limit the use of XLUUVs to coastal surveillance.

"India quietly counters China’s BRI with 7,200 km transport corridor",https://idrw.org/india-quietly-counters-chinas-bri-with-7200-km-transport-corridor/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: IANS The 7,200 km long International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) connecting India and Russia is now rapidly coming to life after remaining a slow starter for years. Next month a host of fresh agreements is set to be inked at the international economic forum to be held at Kazan, a city located in southwest Russia. The agreements are expected to eliminate the current operational roadblocks. With India and Russia determined to strengthen bilateral economic activities including trade amid the changing geopolitical dynamics, the thrust on the corridor changing geopolitical dynamics has gone up. “We intend to sign a bunch of supplemental agreements, first of all on transport services. We have the North-South corridor, where we plan to reach Iran and India via Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and via Azerbaijan. We will ink several agreements in this sphere,” news agency TASS quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin as saying. Last week, a 50-member Indian business delegation were in Russia to explore further opportunities to boost trade between the two countries, which are also in talks for a free trade agreement. The INSTC is envisaged to facilitate easier movement of freight between several countries including India Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan among others. The first cargo from Nhava Sheva Port was flagged off last year in November. Recently at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) defence ministers’ meeting, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Iranian counterpart Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Gharaei Ashtiyani too deliberated on the progress of the project. Initiated by India, Russia and Iran in September 2000 in St. Petersburg, the agreement was signed in 2002. “Now all parties, especially India, Iran and Russia are working to bring the INSTC to life,” SilkRoad Briefing said. India has been focusing on boosting connectivity not just within the country but even outside. The is one in a series of international initiatives involving India and, at the same time, is clearly part of India’s international strategy, beginning in South Asia, of countering the Belt and Road Initiative, Trends Research and Advisory said. Besides the INSTC in another significant move, the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is also expected to start a liner service connecting India with the Gulf nations and the Western Mediterranean region. The shipping service expected to begin in December will start from Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah Islamic Port. It will then call on Jebel Ali in South West Dubai, Mundra and Nhava Sheva in India, Djibouti in Africa, Gioia, Tauro, Salerno and Genoa in Italy, Barcelona and Valencia in Spain, Marsaxlokk in Malta, King Abdullah, which is Saudi Arabia’s newly launched port facility. “India has quietly strengthened its connectivity with various countries through enormous infrastructure building beyond its borders, something to address the challenges arising from the China led Belt and Road Initiative,” an analyst told India Narrative. He added that while the BRI project in many phases is economically unviable, the case is not so in the India-led infrastructure thrust.

Qureshi says Bilawal’s India visit ‘a real opportunity’ to raise bilateral issues,https://idrw.org/qureshi-says-bilawals-india-visit-a-real-opportunity-to-raise-bilateral-issues/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: GEO TV Former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that his successor Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s visit to India is important, saying that issues between Islamabad and New Delhi need to be addressed through dialogue. Qureshi’s comments came during an interview with an Indian media outlet following Bilawal’s visit to Goa to attend the two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers — scheduled to be held on May 4 and 5. Ex-FM, who is the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) vice chairman, when asked if his party was opposing the visit, said: “No, we are not opposing the visit, we do understand that this is a multilateral obligation. As a former foreign minister, who has been to such conclaves, this is an important visit. And by all means, you should go ahead.” Qureshi also said that his party desires peace with India as there are no cultural and trade ties between the two nations. “We need to recognise that we do have outstanding issues. We can’t wish them away. We have to address them.” The PTI senior leader reiterated that the bilateral issues need to be resolved politically and through dialogue. He also said that it “might be useful” if there was a meeting on the sidelines to look at Pak-India ties. “Our diplomatic relations were downgraded after the Pulwama incident and the Balakot misadventure,” he added. Qureshi said that Bilawal had a real opportunity to raise issues that were relevant. “I hope he’s not shy of raising human rights issue, of raising the treatment minorities are getting, particularly Muslims. I hope he is not shy of raising the issue of water, which is becoming increasingly challenging between the two countries.” When asked whether he would want to trade to resume between India and Pakistan, Qureshi said that while trade between the nations makes a lot of economic sense, it cannot be seen in “isolation”. “It has to go in tandem with other things […] but only trade, not enough. That’s all I’m saying. Trade can help improve relations, but trade in itself will not be enough.” The former foreign minister went on to talk about the Kashmir issue, saying that the revocation of Article 370 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was “unilateral” and that many Kashmiris were not happy with the situation. When talking about the Indian foreign minister’s allegations that Pakistan was sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir, Qureshi replied: “What he has to understand is that Pakistan has suffered on account of terrorism. We have paid a huge price, a human price, an economic price. We are not supporting terrorism. What we’re doing is giving them moral and diplomatic political support.” At one point the interviewer also alleged that the attacker of the Pulwama attack came from Pakistan. On February 14, 2019, around 40 Indian soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed and dozens injured at the Srinagar-Jammu Highway in the Awantipora area in the Pulwama district of the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), an attack which is dubbed as the deadliest in over a decade. At this, the PTI leader said: “That’s your point of view. There is a different point of view and that point of view is that it was a self-created, orchestrated incident for political reasons.” “I think India has to come out of this groove that we will not sit until and unless Pakistan gives up terrorism. Pakistan has fought terrorism, Pakistan is in the process of defeating extremism and terrorism. As I said, we have suffered. So let’s not pick that as an excuse and let things simmer.”"

Nepali businesses bleed as Indian pilgrims keep away from Chinese border-crossing during Yatra,https://idrw.org/nepali-businesses-bleed-as-indian-pilgrims-keep-away-from-chinese-border-crossing-during-yatra/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: IANS Thousands of the Indian Hindu pilgrims used to travel to the holy Kailash-Mansarovar region in Tibet every year through the Tatopani border point of Nepal with China until the deadly earthquake struck Nepal in 2015. The religious travellers would fill the hotels and restaurants close to the border point. Sensing the big business opportunity, Bishnu Shrestha, opened a 25-room hotel named Small Heaven in 2013, targeting basically the Indian pilgrims. Before he recovered his investment of NPR 40 million spent to build the hotel, Nepal was hit by a deadly earthquake in 2015, which not only damaged roads, building and other infrastructure around Tatopani areas but also across the border on the Chinese side too. Tatopani border point, which is also one of the two key international border points with China, remained closed for four years since the earthquake. In May 2019, the border was reopened for international trade. Before trade between the two sides made stride through this route, COVID-19 pandemic forced the authorities of both sides to close the border in January 2020 to prevent spread of coronavirus. Since October that year, the border point was opened for one-way flow of Chinese goods to Nepal in a limited quantity. “Before I recovered my investment, an earthquake hit the country and the border point has remained essentially closed ever since,” complained Shrestha. “So, our hotel has also remained open only in the name as hardly any tourists visit this area and stay in hotels here.” Shrestha had to go through much hardship to pay the bank loans with the hotel being unable to generate enough cash flow from its operation of the hotel. “The bank helped me in restructuring the loan and rescheduling the payment deadline when I was struggling to pay the loans,” he said. He still has outstanding loans to pay as he continues to struggle for cash flow in the absence of the regular flow of the customers. After the prolonged gap, Nepal and China are preparing to reopen this border point starting from Monday (May 1) for two-way trade. “We have one truck of handicraft ready to export to China through the Tatopani border point on Monday,” Dayananda K.C, chief customs officer at the Tatopani Customs Office told the India Narrative. According to the Tatopani Customs Office, the Chinese side however would not allow the movement of people across the border. “As per the latest agreement with the Chinese side, the goods from either side will be left on the friendship bridge connecting the two countries and the other side will take the goods. But the Chinese side did not allow the Nepali people to go across the border,” said Dayananda. Before the earthquake in 2015, China used to provide one-day passes to visit the bordering Khasa (Zhangmu) market and return. A significant number of Nepali nationals had set up their own shops in the bordering town. Since the quake hit the bordering region, the Chinese side has already relocated the entire Khasa market to another location. “There is currently no human settlement near the border point now. Only structure that the Chinese side set up near the border point is the building of their customs office,” said Dayananda. But continued restriction on movement of the people from the Chinese side dashed Shrestha’s hope that he could operate his hotel business in full swing any time soon. “Without movement of people, how can we run the hotel? Shrestha asked. Before the border was closed following the earthquake in 2015, his hotel rooms used to remain fully occupied most of the time. “Every day, 100-150 Indian pilgrims used to arrive in the Tatopani area and stay in hotels here,” Shrestha recalled. Now, Nepali people occasionally reach Tatopani (hot water pond) close to the border point. “As the Nepalis don’t go to Tatopani frequently, the hotels here don’t have the source of regular income,” Shrestha said. According to him, there are a dozen hotels in and around the Tatopani area and the fate of all of them is similar. “The newer hotels suffered much because they had not recovered their investments,” he said. The other international border point—Rasuwagadhi-Kerung, which is expected to be the main gateway between the two neighbours reopened for two-way traffic of goods starting from April 1. The Chinese side had opened it for one way traffic of goods since April 2020 but traffic of only a limited number of goods were allowed to pass. It is the border point through which the proposed Kerung-Kathmandu Railway is also supposed to pass through. There is also the proposal to construct the cross-border transmission line through this border point for future electricity trade between the two countries. After nearly three years of disturbances, China on December 28, last year opened the Rasuwagadhi border point even for exports of Nepali goods following the northern neighbour scrapping the ‘Zero Covid’ policy. But China allowed movement of goods in limited quantities alone for the time being. “Since April 1, there has been unrestricted movement of the goods from both sides,” Nararayan Prasad Bhandari, chief customs officer at bordering Rasuwa Customs Office, told the India Narrative. “The Chinese side now allows entry of people residing in bordering Rasuwa district, Nepali government employees and truck drivers who go to bordering Kerung town to take delivery of goods.” It is also one of the routes for Indian pilgrims to go to the holy mountain of Kailash. “It is not immediately clear whether the border point was also opened for the people from the third countries,” said Bhandari. After Tatopani and Rasuwagadi border point was closed by the Chinese side, Indian travellers have been using the Nepalgunj-Humla route in in the western Nepal, the shortest way to reach Kailash Mansarovar through the Himalayan country. Lately, India opened the track of the link road from Dharchula to Lipulekh, a disputed land between Nepal and India. India has aimed to develop this route as Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra Route. Even though Rasuwagadi border point was opened for one-way traffic of goods in April 2020 with occasional closure of the border point over the last three years, Nepali traders suffered badly because of limited clearance of goods from the Chinese customs authorities. Before normal trade resumed in April this year, Nepali traders suffered huge losses due to quantitative restriction on movement of Nepal bound cargo from China. It took 16 months to clear all the Nepal bound goods which were stored in bordering Kerung town since the border point was closed in January 2020. The goods ordered for major festivals like Dashain (Dussehra) and Tihar (Diwali) did not arrive on time from the north as China sent only limited cargo to Nepal. Nepali traders accused China of imposing an “undeclared trade blockade” on Nepal for delayed clearance of Nepal bound goods. But there is no evidence that China clearly had intent of blockading Nepal by imposing quantitative restrictions on cargo movement. “Even after normal trade began in early April this year, China has continued to impose restrictions on the export of Nepal’s agricultural products such as rice, wheat flour, noodles among others,” said Bhandari. Because of prolonged disruption for movement of goods through the land route, the majority of Nepali importers from China diverted their shipment to the sea route. Most Nepal bound goods from China now are brought through Kolkata, India to Nepal. “Along with disruption in smooth flow of Nepal-bound goods, Chinese container owners started to impose freight charges as high as NPR 10,000 per cubic metre of a container from only NPR 1800 per cubic metre,” said Nripa Adhikari, chairperson of Good Luck International, a freight forwarder. “This situation forced many traders to divert their goods to the sea routes.” Adhikari’s company had to pay for 20 cartoons of goods brought by his company for his client in Nepal after they were lost on the way. “We could not check physically by going to China about the goods were delivery in quantity as claimed by the Chinese seller,” he said. “My company had to compensate as much as NPR 700,000 to the Chinese seller for the lost goods.” With the reopening of both international border points, Nepali importers will have more options to bring goods to Nepal. “But there is still doubt among traders about Chinese policy as they close the border abruptly and it is not known when they close and when they open the border,” said Bachhu Poudel, former president of Nepal Trans Himalaya Border Commerce Association, a representative body of traders involved in Nepal-China trade. “We are hopeful no prolonged disruption in movement of goods through the land routes. But there is still a crisis of confidence with the Chinese authorities.” During the first three quarters of the current fiscal year 2022-23 that began in mid-July last year, Nepal imported goods worth Rs 162.44 billion from China, according to the Department of Customs. Only goods worth NPR 28.14 billion were imported through these two northern international border points. Nepal exported goods worth NPR 636.83 million to China during the same period with NPR 273 million going through these border points, the customs statistics show. “There will definitely be more trade through the land route once both border points are reopened fully,” said Poudel. “Nepali traders opt for the land route because they can take delivery of goods in a shorter period than the sea route.”"
"Ahead of PM Modi’s visit, yet another Hindu temple vandalised in Australia",https://idrw.org/ahead-of-pm-modis-visit-yet-another-hindu-temple-vandalised-in-australia/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: IANS A Hindu temple in Australia has been vandalised just weeks ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the country on May 23. The front wall of the BAPS Swaminarayan temple in Rosehill suburb of western Sydney was spray-painted with the message “Declare Modi Terrorist” early on Friday morning, The Australia Today reported. “When I came this morning for prayers I saw ugly vandalism on the front wall,” Sejal Patel, a daily visitor to the temple, said. Temple authorities also found a Khalistani flag hanging on the gate, and reported the matter to New South Wales police. According to the report, police officers visited the temple and have been provided with the CCTV footage of the attack. This incident comes after a brief almost two months of Khalistan activities in Australia. In March, the boundary wall of the Shree Laxmi Narayan Temple in Brisbane was vandalised. In January alone, three Hindu temples in Melbourne were defaced with anti-India graffiti and pro-Bhindranwale slogans by Khalistani supporters, and later, temple priests received threatening calls to raise ‘Khalistan Zindabad’ slogans. Following vandalisation of Hindu temples, Khalistani flags were found attached to the Indian consulate in Brisbane in February — just days after External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit to Australia. India has time and again registered a strong protest with the Australian government asking it to take swift action and bring perpetraters to the book. During his visit to India this year, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had assured Modi of strict action, saying that safety of the Indian community is a priority of his government. Modi is scheduled to travel to Japan, Papua New Guinea and Australia in May with the power-packed visit concluding Down Under where he will attend the Quad summit from May 23-24 in Sydney."

Can configure C-390 as FRA for Indian Air Force : CEO of Embraer,https://idrw.org/can-configure-c-390-as-fra-for-indian-air-force-ceo-of-embraer/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG According to a recent confirmation by Bosco da Costa Junior, President & CEO of Embraer Defense & Security, the C390, a Medium role Transporter aircraft manufactured by Embraer, can be easily converted into a Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) for the Indian Air Force (IAF) if requested. The C390 can be equipped with an air-to-air refuelling system installed under its wing pods, making it a suitable choice for the IAF’s needs. A report by idrw had previously mentioned that the IAF is looking to procure up to 80 Medium role Transporter aircraft to replace its ageing Soviet-era An-32s Transporters, with a focus on local manufacturing in India under transfer of technology (ToT) agreements. The report also stated that the IAF is considering using the same platform for additional purposes, such as Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) systems. In addition to its transport capabilities, the C-390 can also be outfitted with a hose and drogue aerial refuelling system, allowing it to serve as a tanker aircraft and refuel other aircraft in mid-air. This capability makes the C-390 a versatile platform that can support a wide range of military operations. The C-390 has a maximum payload capacity of 26,000 kg and can carry up to 80 troops or 74 paratroopers. It has a range of 2,730 km (1,470 nm) with a full payload, or up to 6,250 km (3,375 nm) with no payload. The aircraft is equipped with two International Aero Engines (IAE) V2500-E5 turbofan engines, each producing 31,330 lbf of thrust. One of the unique features of the C-390 is its ability to operate from unpaved and short runways, allowing it to reach remote and poorly serviced areas. It can take off and land on runways as short as 1,100 meters (3,609 feet), and can operate on rough or gravel surfaces."
Possible US Response if France and India Pursue Government-to-Government Deal on Fighter Jets,https://idrw.org/possible-us-response-if-france-and-india-pursue-government-to-government-deal-on-fighter-jets/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG The Indian Air Force’s plan to acquire 114 multi-role fighter jets (MRFA) for $20 billion has been hit by delays in issuing Requests for Proposals (RFP). The tender, which is the largest for fighter jets, has made little or no progress in the last four years, causing concern among defence analysts. However, there is hope that the process will move forward soon. Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari, the Deputy Chief of the Air Force, recently said that he expects the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for MRFA to be issued within the next three to four months. IAF Chief VR Chaudhari has repeatedly emphasized the importance of acquiring 114 jets, saying that they are crucial to the revival of the IAF’s declining combat fleet. While the IAF supports indigenous programs like Tejas Mk2 and AMCA for its fleet growth over the next 20 years, there is no substitute for the MRFA. The delay in the tender process has led to concerns about India’s defence preparedness, particularly in light of the growing security challenges in the region. However, the Indian government has assured that it is committed to modernizing the armed forces and enhancing their operational capabilities. France, which has already sold 36 Dassault Rafale fighter jets to the Indian Air Force, is now trying to turn the MRFA tender into a Government-to-Government deal. The aim is to reduce delays and establish a second production line in India, which would further boost the export potential of the Rafale to other markets and alleviate pressure on the French production line. With its prior successful deal, France is considered a strong contender in the MRFA competition and hopes to secure the contract with this proposal. According to sources familiar with the matter, IDRW has learned that the recent demonstration of the F-35A fighter jets in India was part of the US administration’s efforts to pitch its 5th generation fighter jet to India. The US is also trying to secure a deal for its 4.5th generation F-21 and F-15EX, even though they have a low chance of being selected by the Indian Air Force (IAF). The US administration is well aware of the French attempts to convert the MRFA tender into a Government-to-Government (G2G) deal. In response, the US has been preparing a counteroffer for its F-35A. People familiar with the matter have suggested that a G2G deal for the F-35A might not be far away. The US administration is keen to have India on its side when it comes to China. They believe that the S-400 system operated by the IAF is unlikely to be a deal breaker if India is willing to install some of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) around the jet. By securing a deal for the F-35A, the US hopes to strengthen its strategic partnership with India and increase its exports of advanced fighter jets to the country."

The OFK has prepared a large number of these cartridges, and the supply to the Air Force will commence once the order is received. The cartridge’s main function is to activate the electric extinguisher system, which is attached to the pilot of the fighter aircraft. This cartridge is designed to depressurize it when it senses that the aircraft is prone to fire while operating, activating the on-board fire extinguisher system immediately. It creates pressure in the system to extinguish the fire. Until now, the cartridge was manufactured by private companies, but the limited supply led to a lack of interest from private manufacturers. The mechanical components were manufactured, but the cartridge’s quality often failed. Consequently, the Air Force has authorized OFK to manufacture this equipment for its fighter aircraft and helicopters. The A-5 and F-1 sections were responsible for this development. Experts associated with the project stated that there was no set technology to follow, but they prepared it using engineering in the interest of the country."

Shah noted that currently, there is no 100% specific solution to counter the drone menace, but agencies are continuously fighting the issue. Intelligence gathering has been increased at the ground level, and those receiving illegal shipments have been caught, resulting in the shooting down of a significantly increased number of drones in the past three months. In 2020, 22 unmanned aerial vehicles were shot down by security forces after entering Indian territory from Pakistan. The use of drones to smuggle weapons and drugs has been a growing problem, with the recent April 20 attack on an army truck in Jammu & Kashmir’s Mendhar serving as a tragic example. The weapons used in the attack were reportedly brought into India via drones. In response, the Indian government has been exploring various solutions, including the use of anti-drone technologies, to counter the increasing use of drones for nefarious purposes."

The ties between India and China nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. The Indian and the Chinese troops are locked in a standoff in a few friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh for the last three years though they disengaged in several places following a series of military and diplomatic talks. India has been maintaining that the relationship between the two countries should be based on “three mutuals” — mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests. The eastern Ladakh border standoff erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area. As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in 2021 on the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area."

The family has experienced three attacks, and they do not feel safe, according to Khalsa Vox, a portal on news related to Punjab politics, history, culture, and heritage. Harman’s restaurant was attacked by pro-Khalistan supporters, an incident that occurred after the Indian High Commission in London was vandalised last month. Harman then posted a video which garnered two million views in two days, leading to abusive calls, social media trolling, and threats against him and his family. He claimed that the threats began after he posted a video on TikTok, in which he said, “This Khalistan movement started a while back and then it died down. Today again, a section of people who are settled in Canada, in England and Australia want Khalistan but those in India don’t want it.” Harman said that following the video, he received death threats and his restaurant was attacked. The attackers demanded that he remove the video, raise pro-Khalistan slogans, and burn the Indian flag, or face death. Harman said his wife and his daughter even received several rape threats. “Our address was put online with calls to rape and kill them. Videos of miscreants licking the pictures of my wife and daughter were posted as well,” he added, according to Bitter Winter.

These pro-Khalistan groups artificially inflate their influence and attract disproportionate attention by lobbying political bodies under the guise of human rights activism. As per the news report, the actions of pro-Khalistan groups create a false image of legitimacy which is not according to the beliefs of the Sikh faith. It is important to understand that Khalistani separatists do not represent the views of most of British Sikh communities, as per the Khalsa Vox report."

"J&K Panthers Party Founder’s Son Removed From Blacklist, Gets Emergency Visa",https://idrw.org/jk-panthers-party-founders-son-removed-from-blacklist-gets-emergency-visa/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) founder Bhim Singh’s son has been removed from a blacklist and issued an emergency visa to attend his mother’s funeral after he apologised to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for participating in an anti-government protest in London last year. Ankit Love (39), who is based in London, was given a three-month emergency visa on Thursday to attend his mother’s last rites, which, according to him, will take place on the banks of Devika river in Udhampur district on Friday afternoon. “I am reaching Jammu tomorrow (Friday) morning to say the final goodbye to my mother,” Love told PTI on the phone from Delhi on his arrival from abroad. He said he is happy that his apology was considered by the government and he was provided with the visa to perform the last rites of his mother, whose body is lying in a mortuary for the past week. Earlier, Love shared a copy of his visa on Facebook with the message, “Thank you India for taking me off the blacklist so that I may go and attend my mother’s funeral. God bless”. The only son of JKNPP founder Bhim Singh has apologised to Prime Minister Modi for participating in an anti-government protest in February last year that led to him being blacklisted by the High Commission. In an open letter to the prime minister, Love said that he regrets throwing eggs and stones at the High Commission during the February 2022 protest and requested the prime minister to intervene so that he could return and perform the funeral of his mother Jay Mala (64). Mala, a Supreme Court lawyer, died on April 26 and her body has been kept at the mortuary of Government Medical College (GMC) hospital in Jammu after Love requested it be kept there till he returns to perform the last rites. This comes even as his relatives are engaged in a tussle to take control of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP), which has been in disarray following Bhim Singh’s death on May 31, 2022. Love could not attend his father’s funeral as well. “Praise Shiva! Mom, I will be there tomorrow! Promise. Thank you Prime Minister Narendra Modi and everyone for your loving support to get me back home for my mom’s funeral. Peace & #Love ProfBhim Singh,” he said in another post on Facebook. According to Love, he was blacklisted by India after the British police arrested him following a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London on February 14, 2022. In the open letter to the prime minister on Tuesday, Love said he deeply and sincerely regrets his actions and apologises for his mistake of throwing eggs and stones at the High Commission. “I will be deeply thankful if you could kindly forgive me and allow me to visit Jammu to perform the last rites of my mother — I need to reach Jammu urgently as everyone is waiting for my arrival to perform the last rites,” he said, adding it was also the wish of his mother. Mentioning the Indian High Commission’s denial of approval for his travel, he said, “I assure you that henceforth there will be no such act by me against my Nation which I love very much and am very much proud of.”"
Foreign Ministers Of SCO Nations To Finalise On 15 Decisions At Goa Meet,https://idrw.org/foreign-ministers-of-sco-nations-to-finalise-on-15-decisions-at-goa-meet/,"May 5, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member countries will finalise in their deliberations on Friday a set of 15 decisions or proposals for the consideration of the grouping’s summit in July, people familiar with the matter said. The proposals are aimed at expanding cooperation among the SCO member countries in the areas of trade, technology, commerce, security and socio-cultural ties. The SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting at the sea-side Taj Exotica resort in Goa’s Benaulim will be chaired by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov, Pakistan’s Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Uzbekistan’s Bakhtiyor Saidov are among those who have already arrived in Goa to attend the meeting. The people cited above said Friday’s meeting is expected to finalise agreements for the inclusion of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Myanmar and the Maldives as dialogue partners in the SCO. The process to admit Iran and Belarus as full members of the grouping is reaching its final stage, they said. The people also said a proposal on the settlement of trade in national currencies by the SCO member countries is also part of the overall agenda of the grouping to boost cooperation. The SCO foreign ministers are also expected to deliberate on pressing global issues, including the Ukraine crisis and the situation in Afghanistan. “The most important work before the SCO foreign ministers will be to assess the status of the decisions that will be approved at the SCO summit in New Delhi in July,” Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Dammu Ravi told reporters. “The meeting will also give an opportunity to discuss the state of multilateral cooperation in the SCO, regional and global issues of interest, reform and modernisation of the organisation and the progress of admitting Iran and Belarus to the SCO as new member states,” he said. “As you are aware, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has articulated India’s priorities for the SCO chair with the theme of ‘Towards a SECURE SCO’,” Ravi said. He said the acronym SECURE was given by Modi at the 2018 Qingdao summit of the SCO and it will lay down the main focus areas under India’s ongoing chairmanship. SECURE stands for Security, Economic development, Connectivity, Unity, Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and Environmental protection. Under its SCO presidency, India has hosted more than 100 meetings and events. India is emerging as a key player among the SCO countries, though China and Russia are seen as the major drivers of the grouping that is increasingly seen as an “alternative” to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). India is hosting the SCO conclave when its ties with China are under severe strain in view of a lingering border row in eastern Ladakh. People familiar with the preparations for the conclave said the foreign ministers will deliberate on the overall challenges facing the region in the backdrop of the current geopolitical turmoil and the state of bilateral ties between the member nations would not impact the discussions. The SCO is an influential economic and security bloc and has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations. It was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan became its permanent members in 2017. India was made an observer at the SCO in 2005 and has generally participated in the ministerial-level meetings of the grouping, which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian region. India has shown a keen interest in deepening its security-related cooperation with the SCO and its Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS), which specifically deals with issues relating to security and defence."

US Looks Past India’s Rights Record as China Worries Deepen,https://idrw.org/us-looks-past-indias-rights-record-as-china-worries-deepen/,"May 4, 2023","SOURCE: BLOOMBERG The Biden administration has decided to remain publicly quiet on India’s democratic backsliding, according to senior US officials, as the US intensifies efforts to keep New Delhi on its side in the rivalry with China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pressure on religious minorities and the media is troubling, as is his party’s targeting of opposition lawmakers, said the officials, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. But the decision to largely refrain from criticizing Modi comes as growing concerns about China make India increasingly crucial to US geopolitical and economic goals in the Indo-Pacific. The decision on handling India is an example of how President Joe Biden’s emphasis on human rights — and his framing of a global conflict between democracies and autocracies — has run up against the strategic realities of a world where rivals such as China and Russia are vying for greater control. So while New Delhi’s strong defense ties with Russia and its vast purchases of Russian crude have drawn scrutiny from US lawmakers after the invasion of Ukraine, the administration believes it needs India to buy that oil to keep prices low. And rising concerns about China’s growing assertiveness under Xi Jinping have helped drive the US and India even closer together, these people said. “India is getting this free pass on account of China,” said Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi who has advised previous Indian administrations on national security issues. “The only country in Asia, in terms of size and potential, that can balance China is India.” In a sign of the close ties, Biden is set to host Modi for a state dinner in Washington this summer. While Biden might press Modi to take a more explicit stance on Ukraine, one US official said it’s doubtful New Delhi would publicly rebuke Russia, given their close defense ties. Asked whether the administration is reluctant to criticize Modi, John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement, “As we do with other nations around the world, we regularly engage with Indian government officials at senior levels on human rights concerns, including freedom of religion or belief.” US officials also have frequently pointed to India’s shipments of humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well as Modi’s comments to Russian President Vladimir Putin that “today’s era is not one for war.” One official said China’s growing assertiveness has also fueled New Delhi’s commitment to the Quad strategic grouping that also includes the US, Australia and Japan. India’s foreign ministry declined to comment. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has made no secret of his country’s decision not to pick sides regardless of what others may want, echoing India’s Cold War leadership of what was called the “non-aligned movement.” “Whether it is the United States, Europe, Russia or Japan, we are trying to ensure that all ties, all these ties, advance without seeking exclusivity,” Jaishankar said during a visit to the Dominican Republic last month. As India eclipses China as the world’s most populous country with more than 1.4 billion people, the Biden administration believes it’s impossible to solve pressing global challenges such as climate change without New Delhi, one official said, and the country remains a central part of the US’s Indo-Pacific strategy. That’s led to the relative silence on issues that the US would normally speak out about publicly, and loudly. Most recently, India’s government banned a critical documentary about Modi released by the BBC and sent federal tax authorities to raid the British news organization’s Delhi office. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party also won a defamation case against the main political opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, that has seen him kicked out of parliament. Modi’s government has also choked local and international nongovernmental organizations of foreign funding. Other Indian moves also run against a greater strategic alignment with Washington: In recent months, India pledged closer defense ties with Russia. Although India has sought to scale back purchases of some Russian weapons, its military has more than 250 Russian-designed fighter jets, seven Russian submarines and hundreds of Russian tanks. It has also received Russian S-400 missile defense systems despite US efforts to keep those purchases from going forward. “President Biden would be remiss if he doesn’t raise the Russia issue and restate the importance of supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and explain why that is important for the Indo-Pacific region,” said Lisa Curtis, who was the National Security Council senior director for South and Central Asia under former President Donald Trump. “It’s no use pretending we don’t have serious differences on such a crucial issue,” said Curtis, who directs the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. The US has also moved on from concerns about India’s vast purchases of Russian crude oil even as the country rejects a Group of Seven initiative to put a cap on the price for which it’s sold. At one meeting in Delhi between US and Indian officials following the invasion of Ukraine, a US diplomat told a senior Indian official that if their refiners weren’t buying Russian crude and putting it back on global markets, oil prices might have soared to about $180 a barrel, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Indian officials always viewed Western criticism of their oil purchases as hypocritical, given that Indian refiners do put the product on global markets. But India has emerged as a major market for redirected Russian oil, taking advantage of cheaper barrels to help curb inflation and spur growth. Russia is now India’s top supplier, surpassing Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and in March the average cost of Moscow’s crude landing on its shores hit the lowest level since the war in Ukraine began. Jaishankar, the foreign minister, has often invoked broader sentiment in the so-called Global South as he defended his country’s position on Ukraine amid soaring food and energy prices that have put immense pressure on poor countries. He has waved off US concerns about India’s human rights record, saying “people are entitled to have views about us.” It’s a strategy that has its share of critics. In an article in Foreign Affairs published May 1 titled “America’s Bad Bet on India,” former State Department adviser Ashley Tellis argued India wouldn’t join a conflict between Washington and Beijing unless India’s own security was directly threatened. “Washington’s current expectations of India are misplaced,” he wrote. The US’s positioning on India reflects a calculation it’s had to make several times in the past, most prominently with Saudi Arabia. After declaring during his presidential campaign that he would declare Saudi Arabia a “pariah,” Biden has had to backtrack as he seeks the kingdom’s help countering Iran and keeping oil prices low. “I can understand governments’ reluctance to take on Modi,” said Shashi Tharoor, a senior lawmaker in the opposition Congress Party. “There’s an overriding strategic interest on the part of the West, and other countries in Southeast Asia, in staying on the right side of India.”"
Pakistan’s decision to attend SCO meet in India reflects its ‘commitment’ to multilateralism: PM Sharif,https://idrw.org/pakistans-decision-to-attend-sco-meet-in-india-reflects-its-commitment-to-multilateralism-pm-sharif/,"May 4, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said Pakistan’s decision to attend the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in India reflects its “commitment” to the SCO Charter and multilateralism as he asserted that his country was committed to playing its part to advance its shared values of peace and stability in the region. Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari travelled to Goa on Thursday to attend a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), in the first such high-level visit to India from Pakistan since 2011. Bilawal’s visit comes amid continued strain in ties between India and Pakistan on a number of issues including Islamabad’s continued support to cross-border terrorism. “Pakistan’s decision to attend SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting in India reflects our commitment to the SCO Charter & multilateralism,” Sharif tweeted. “We are committed to playing our part to advance our shared values of peace & stability in the region. We are all for win-win understandings based on connectivity, trade and mutually advantageous cooperation,” he further said. Bilawal, who is the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India since 2011, is leading a delegation to the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) of the Beijing-based Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). “During my visit, which is focused exclusively on the SCO, I look forward to constructive discussions with my counterparts from friendly countries,” Bilawal tweeted before his departure. Opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party has “strongly condemned” Bilawal’s visit to Goa, saying his participation would have been possible on video. “Pak Foreign policy is dead by all definitions of the word,” senior PTI leader and former information minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said in a tweet. Pakistan has said that its foreign minister would not hold any meeting with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. The visit is highly symbolic as it is the first by any Pakistani Foreign Minister since Hina Rabbani Khar travelled to India in July 2011 for peace talks. Besides Pakistan, SCO member states include China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and India. Since becoming a member in 2017, Pakistan has been actively and constructively contributing to all SCO activities to realise its multi-sectoral aims and objectives in a mutually beneficial manner, the FO said. At the conclave, the foreign ministers will deliberate on overall challenges facing the region in the backdrop of the current geo-political turmoil and the state of bilateral ties between member nations would not impact the discussions. The SCO is an influential economic and security bloc and has emerged as one of the largest trans-regional international organisations. The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after India’s warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan in February 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack. The relations further deteriorated after India announced the withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories in 2019."
Taking the high road: India infrastructure drive counters China,https://idrw.org/taking-the-high-road-india-infrastructure-drive-counters-china/,"May 4, 2023","SOURCE: AFP Freshly laid roads, bridges, upgraded military camps, and new civilian infrastructure dot the winding high Himalayan route to the Indian frontier village of Zemithang — which China renamed last month to press its claim to the area. It is in the far northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, almost all of which Beijing insists falls under its sovereignty as “South Tibet”. The Asian giants fought a war in 1962 over their 3,500-kilometre (2,200-mile) divide, now known as the Line of Actual Control, and it remains disputed to this day, with sporadic clashes and regular diplomatic manoeuvres. Culturally largely Tibetan, Arunachal Pradesh is savage territory for battle, with mountain passes as high as 4,750 metres (15,000 feet) still covered in snowdrifts as late as May, and thickly forested slopes lower down. Now both powers are engaged in major construction drives to reinforce their positions. New Delhi bristled at Beijing’s announcement renaming Zemithang — dubbed “Bangqin” — and 10 other sites in April. Foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said the state “is, has been, and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India”, adding: “Attempts to assign invented names will not alter this reality.” Beijing has sought to change the facts by force before. Zemithang, just a few kilometres from the boundary, and picture-postcard Tawang, the main town in the district — home to the biggest and oldest Tibetan Buddhist monastery outside Lhasa — were both seized by Chinese forces in 1962 as they inflicted a humiliating defeat on Indian troops before retreating. The Indian army officer charged with preventing a repetition is Brigadier N.M. Bendigeri, who commands thousands of troops in Tawang. Hundreds of his men clashed with Chinese forces in December. And three years ago in Ladakh, at the western end of the frontier, 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Beijing’s announcements “won’t change a thing here”, Bendigeri said. But in fact, Chinese actions are profoundly changing the once neglected and remote region. Balancing act – Worried about China’s build-up on the other side, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has pumped billions of dollars into ambitious connectivity projects, to boost civilian presence, and establish new paramilitary battalions. India has scaled up its defences, deploying cruise missiles, howitzers, US-made Chinook transport helicopters and drones. At the same time, in an indication of New Delhi’s constant geopolitical balancing act, India is part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which includes China and Russia. As the grouping’s current chair, on Friday it hosts a meeting of its foreign ministers in Goa. But in the face of China’s increased assertiveness under leader Xi Jinping it has also become a member of the so-called Quad with the US, Australia and Japan, set up to counter Beijing. Within days of Beijing’s renaming announcement, India’s powerful interior minister Amit Shah launched a $585 million “vibrant villages” scheme for civilians along the border. “India wants peace with everyone,” said Shah at Kibithoo, one of the first Arunachal Pradesh villages overrun in 1962. “But no one will be able to encroach on even an inch of our country’s land”. – ‘Dual-use ghost villages’ – New Delhi has expressed alarm over its neighbour’s push to develop “xiaokang” — meaning well-to-do villages in Mandarin — along the Line of Actual Control. Bendigeri fears they will be “dual-use ghost villages”, intended to alter realities on the ground. He also worries the People’s Liberation Army could use them during a conflict, echoing the way Beijing has built militarised artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea. But India’s capacity to respond is constrained by the fact its military budget is, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, little more than a quarter of China’s. And New Delhi can only persuade civilians to stay in the areas, rather than compel them. Modi’s government said last year it had sanctioned 35 infrastructure schemes and 2,319 kilometres of roads in the state.

Violence initially broke out during a protest march on Tuesday by thousands of tribal people opposing a demand by a non-tribal group for the constitutionally defined status of a scheduled tribe. Indian army sources said troops and the paramilitary Assam Rifles evacuated more than 7,500 people of different communities through Wednesday night and Thursday, sheltering them in the troops’ camps and government premises. “We are working on a war footing with army and paramilitary troopers deployed in strength to defuse any kind of communal clashes, protests, and blockades,” a senior police officer, who sought anonymity, told Reuters from the state capital of Imphal. Mobile internet services have been suspended for five days statewide, amid incidents of fighting among young men and volunteers of different communities, the state government said in a statement. In a social media post, N. Biren Singh, the chief minister of Manipur, which shares a border with Myanmar, pleaded with joined hands for people to maintain peace and harmony, adding that “precious life” had been lost in the clashes. There was no official confirmation of deaths, however. Tuesday’s march in the Churachandpur district was called by a students’ union, the All Tribal Students’ Union Manipur (ATSUM), to protest against a demand by the majority, non-tribal Meitei community for the status of a Scheduled Tribe (ST). “The situation is tense but we are trying to engage community leaders in a dialogue process,” the district magistrate in the area, Sharath Chandra, told Reuters. That would help bring the situation under control, in addition to security measures taken to deter violence, he added. The curfew will run for an indefinite period. Television channels broadcast images of both tribals, who make up about 40% of the state’s population of 3.6 million, and Meiteis burning tyres on roads and setting fire to some houses in parts of the state."

They will meet local farmers, and relevant officials and visit cherry orchards and inspect the quality of the exotic fruit, he added. Pakistan and China signed a cooperation protocol during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Beijing in November last year. Under the protocol, China will import cherries from Pakistan and help the local grower enhance production. Currently, China imports the bulk of its cherries from South American countries to meet growing demand. However, the transportation cost and time is a major predicament, reported The Nation. Qadir also said the annual demand of the Chinese market is around 350,000 metric tons but Gilgit-Baltistan produces around 5,000 metric tons of cherry per season. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang is in Pakistan for Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue. During the dialogue, the Chinese foreign minister told Pakistan to overcome political differences to pave the way for economic progress, Voice of America (VOA) news reported. “We sincerely hope the political forces in Pakistan will build consensus, uphold stability and more effectively address domestic and external challenges so it can focus on growing the economy,” Qin said, addressing a press briefing alongside his Pakistani counterpart, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Pakistan is facing intense political turmoil since former prime minister Imran Khan was ousted a year ago in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence. A lack of consensus between Khan’s party and the 13-party ruling alliance led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif regarding the election schedule has plunged the country into a political and constitutional crisis. The country also is mired in a crippling financial crisis. To help Pakistan revive a stalled bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and avoid default, China has provided relief by rolling over debt and parking funds there to boost dangerously low foreign exchange reserves."

"Jaishankar set to hold bilateral talks with Chinese, Russian counterparts on Thursday",https://idrw.org/jaishankar-set-to-hold-bilateral-talks-with-chinese-russian-counterparts-on-thursday/,"May 4, 2023","SOURCE: PTI External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is set to hold separate bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang and Russia’s Sergey Lavrov at a beach resort in Goa on Thursday on the sidelines of a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) amid rapidly evolving regional security situation. In the talks with Qin, Jaishankar is once again expected to convey that India-China ties cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border areas, people familiar with the matter said. Qin, Lavrov, their Pakistani counterpart Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and foreign ministers of other SCO countries are arriving in Goa on Thursday to attend a crucial conclave of the SCO that is taking place ahead of the annual summit of the grouping in the first week of July. India is the current chair of the grouping. The two-day SCO foreign ministerial meeting will begin with a gala reception at a luxury beach resort in Goa on Thursday while the main deliberations will take place on Friday. The people cited above said Jaishankar will hold separate bilateral talks with his counterparts from almost all SCO countries. However, there is no clarity on such a meeting between Jaishankar and Bhutto-Zardari. The bilateral meeting between Jaishankar and Qin will be the second one in the last two months. The Chinese foreign minister visited India in March to attend a meeting of the G20 foreign ministers. On the sidelines of the meeting, Jaishankar held talks with Qin during which he conveyed to his Chinese counterpart that the state of India-China relations is “abnormal” because of the lingering border row in eastern Ladakh. Last week, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart Li Shangfu at a meeting that China’s violation of existing border agreements “eroded” the entire basis of ties between the two countries and that all issues relating to the frontier must be resolved in accordance with the existing pacts. The meeting on April 27 took place in New Delhi on the sidelines of a conclave of the SCO defence ministers. The ties between India and China nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. The Indian and the Chinese troops are locked in a standoff in a few friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh for the last three years though they disengaged in several places following a series of military and diplomatic talks. India has been maintaining that the relationship between the two countries should be based on “three mutuals” — mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests. The people cited above said Jaishankar and Russian foreign minister Lavrov in their meeting are set to review the overall bilateral ties with a focus on trade and commercial engagement. India has been pressing Russia for urgently addressing the trade imbalance that has been in favour of Moscow. India’s trade deficit with Russia jumped significantly in the last few months after it procured significant volumes of discounted crude oil from that country in the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis. Sources said Lavrov will arrive in India as scheduled notwithstanding escalation in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Russia on Wednesday accused Ukraine of attacking the Kremlin with drones overnight in an unsuccessful attempt to kill President Vladimir Putin. The talks between Jaishankar and Lavrov are also set to cover a number of issues relating to bilateral ties and regional situations, they said. Jaishankar is also likely to hold separate bilateral talks with his counterparts from some other SCO countries on Friday. India is hosting the SCO in its capacity as the grouping’s chair. The people said the foreign ministers will deliberate on overall challenges facing the region in the backdrop of the current geo-political turmoil and the state of bilateral ties between the member nations would not impact the discussions. The SCO is an influential economic and security bloc and has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations. The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan became its permanent members in 2017. India was made an observer at the SCO in 2005 and has generally participated in the ministerial-level meetings of the grouping, which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian region. India has shown a keen interest in deepening its security-related cooperation with the SCO and its Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS), which specifically deals with issues relating to security and defence."

However, in an exclusive interview with ANI, defence expert Dhruv Katoch on Wednesday said, “Very frankly, I don’t think this visit is going to be very productive. He doesn’t really have that maturity and depth of wisdom to be a statesman and to sort of conduct himself with a level of maturity.” The upcoming visit of Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to India to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers’ meeting to be held in Goa from May 4-5 has garnered a lot of traction in the media. As the current Chair, India will host the next Summit of the Council of Heads of State this year. The SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting is scheduled to take place in Goa on May 4-5. Bhutto-Zardari will lead the Pakistani delegation to the meeting of SCO Foreign Ministers (CFM), according to Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry. Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov are also likely to participate in the meeting. Katoch further said that this is an SCO visit, so, as per the protocol only matters pertaining to SCO will be discussed. “It will be inappropriate for Mr Bhutto to raise bilateral issues. I don’t see this happening during the course of the conference. However, after the conference is over, I am quite certain that Indian journalists will interview Mr Bhutto and I think in that interview whatever Mr Bhutto has to speak — he will actually speak there, that will be designed for both the Indian and Pakistani audience. I am certain, during that interaction with the media, he is going to raise bilateral issues, especially Kashmir,” he said. Notably, Bhutto-Zardari’s visit comes after the Poonch attack. On April 20, an Army vehicle passing Bhimber Gali and Poonch in the Rajouri sector was fired upon by unidentified terrorists, through grenades, which lead to the death of five soldiers. “When we are looking at the ground situation, I think that the Indian stand is very clear now. We are not going to carry out any bilateral engagement or talks with Pakistan till such time that terrorism stops and we have to have visible proof of that terrorism, so, when India says, talks and terrorism cannot go together, we mean it. I don’t think there is going to have any breakthrough just because Mr Bhutto has come and he is a young man and he is 30+ years and he is a foreign minister — any earth-shaking event is going to take place. This person, very frankly in Pakistani politics is quite inconsequential — he is coming here and making some statements to earn some brownie points in Pakistan. I think that is what will actually happen,” Katoch told ANI. He also lambasted Pakistani FM for making “derogatory” remarks at Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a press conference at the United Nations in New York in December 2022. “The statement made by Mr Bhutto — he is a young man and he comes from a very long line of diplomats. For him to make such a statement against PM Modi — spoke of a very low calibre. He should have not done it. I think it will behove him and his country when he comes to India to apologize for that statement. I don’t think he will do it, but, if he does it, I think, he can regain some stature, otherwise, he has reduced himself to a very low level by a statement which should not have been uttered by a foreign minister,” said Katoch. BJP leader from Jammu, Kavinder Gupta also stressed that terrorism and diplomacy cannot go hand-in-hand over Bhutto-Zardari’s visit to India. “India has made relations with every country through diplomacy, but Pakistan has always back-stabbed us. Many times they were taught lessons. This is a good initiative, but they have to understand. India’s diplomacy today under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has achieved a lot. Pakistan needs to learn from it, there are many things which can be sorted by talking with each other, but Pakistan is away from it. I think that such an initiative is a start, Pakistan should think over it as a way forward,” Gupta told ANI. This will be the first high-level visit in seven years when Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz visited India in December 2016. Also, Bilawal will be the first foreign minister to visit India after a gap of nearly 12 years, reported Business Recorder. In 2011, then Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar visited India. Meanwhile, Captain Anil Gaur, a defence expert said that it was a “welcome step” and Pakistan finally has “mustered the courage to come to India.” “Very welcome step, finally Pakistan FM has mustered the courage to come to India because of the way he has been talking against India and PM Modi at United Nations and other forums also,” Gaur told ANI. Gaur also praised External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and said that he is “capable and competent.” “EAM Jaishankar is capable and competent to put across to Bilawal Bhutto that what Pakistan has to do in case it wants to normalize relations with India. Without normalizing relations with India, there is no future for Pakistan also, because the entire trade that is going on now is routed to Dubai, making everything more expensive. So to get cheaper things from India, they have to mend their ways, stop exporting terrorism and all and fine-tune their own army and their attitude towards India, then only Pakistan can s. Without India’s help – trade and other things Pakistan will not be able to survive. This will be put across to Bilawal Bhutto by our Foreign Minister Jaishankar,” he added. Gaur said that Pakistan is on the edge of a financial crisis and if they have good trade relations with India then they can come out of this devastating situation, but this can happen only if Pakistan stop terrorism. Meanwhile, ex-diplomat Sudhir Devre highlighted India’s prominence in the backdrop of the G20 presidency and SCO Chairship. “India has good relations with Eurasia – Russia and 4 members of SCO have close ties with India. China has played a key role in SCO as China and Russia started this organisation. As India is neutral, it will play a significant role this time. India is bullish on the economic front, have helped many countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, India is respected worldwide,” told Devre to ANI. India will host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in New Delhi On July 3-4, which will be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s first visit to the country since the conflict in Ukraine. The agenda for the Summit, which is anticipated to centre on counter-terror, Afghan stability, inclusive connectivity efforts including Chabahar Port & INSTC, aside from India’s extensive outreach to Eurasia, will be finalised at the SCO Foreign Ministers meeting in Goa on May 4-5"

The AFSOD is now under the Department of Military Affairs and includes the officers and men from the Army Parachute Regiment, Marine Commandos from the Navy and Garud commandos from the Indian Air Force. The AFSOD has been carrying out extensive war games for both internal and external operations and has also been deployed for counter-terrorist operations in Jammu and Kashmir. “Bengaluru is also well suited for operations for a force like the AFSOD as there are multiple airstrips near their location,” the officials said. The AFSOD was one of the three defence agencies created in 2018-19 as part of the efforts to enhance jointness and integration among the forces. The tri-services special forces recently carried out war games near the chickens’ neck area near the Siliguri corridor and have been regularly practising operations in the Andaman and Nicobar Island territory. The troops under the division have also held exercises near the Pakistan border in the Kutch area of Gujarat. The AFSOD has also now started preparing for external exigencies like the one which happened in the 1980s in Maldives."

While addressing the United Nations Security Council during the open debate on the topic of ‘future-proofing trust for sustaining peace’, Kamboj said that from the Indian delegation’s perspective, if the council have to future-proof or secure the future, one needs to first and foremost draw the right lessons from history. “Is the Security Council in its present form which denies permanent representation to entire continents of Africa, Latin America, and the world’s largest democracy can it deem to be inclusive by making five members more equal than others?” she asked. She further asked the organization “Does the Council’s normative framework eliminate inequality or does it tend to perpetuate it? Will we be able to credibly improve the Council’s effectiveness at any stage when it is a fact that we don’t even have a time frame for concluding the decadal discussions on Security Council reform? And can we actually be future-proofing trust for sustaining peace through the Council till we arrive at credible answers to these core questions?” Talking about the fundamental steps that the Security Council to make the organization inclusive and normative frameworks, Kamboj said that multilateral institutions must be made more accountable to their membership. The institutions must be open and welcoming to a diversity of viewpoints, particularly from the global south. The Council must be made more representative of developing countries if it is to continue to engender trust and confidence in its ability to provide leadership to the entire world. It can deliver effective solutions only if it gives a voice to the voiceless, she said. The permanent representative to the UN also stated that the Security Council should also respect the regional approach adopted by countries involved and work in collaboration with regional organizations to address peacebuilding challenges. We believe that regional organizations have an important role to play in tackling global challenges with the UN and the core of multilateral efforts. A comprehensive approach focusing on sustainable development, inclusive economic growth, and political processes is critical for peacebuilding and sustaining peace."
China wants control over entire India-Pacific,https://idrw.org/china-wants-control-over-entire-india-pacific/,"May 4, 2023","SOURCE: ANI China has territorial disputes with more countries than it shares its borders with. The Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, with Xi Jinping at the helm, has used deceitful tactics and manipulation in order to attempt to assert territorial control over other sovereign territories. Beijing has flouted all international norms in its expansionist bid to control more territory. A strained Indo-Chinese relationship is witnessing a further plunge, courtesy of China’s repeated illegal and provocative campaigns to alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border between the two nuclear-armed countries. China has now staked claims on parts of India’s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, arguing that these locations were part of greater Tibet. A desperate Beijing unilaterally renamed as many as 11 Indian locations, which included names of mountain peaks, rivers and residential areas. This is not the first time that Beijing has employed such tactics. Previously in 2017 and 2021, China’s Civil Affair Ministry had renamed other Indian locations triggering another political confrontation. New Delhi called out China’s expansionist plans then, and New Delhi is calling out China’s expansionist plans now. The official spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Arindam Bagchi, while commenting on China’s attempt of showing its domination in places belonging to India’s Arunachal Pradesh said in a MEA said, “This is not the first time that China has attempted something like this (changing the names of areas in Arunachal Pradesh) and we have already condemned any such attempts. Regarding Arunachal Pradesh, we had also said that Arunachal Pradesh is an inseparable part of India) and imposing invented names like these will not at all change the reality.” China is aggressively trying to increase its influence in the Indo-Pacific region, which is home to 65 nearly per cent of the world’s population. According to the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), China’s rise as an economic and military powerhouse has resulted in a tectonic shift in the power balance. ORF research indicates that managing the rise of a tactfully aggressive China will be critical for the safety, security, and stability of the Indo-Pacific. And while the majority of the countries in the Indo-Pacific region are now facing territorial conflicts with China, they find India, Australia and Japan as emerging power centres that can both challenge and check China’s ambitionist and expansionist plans. Satoru Nagao, a Fellow (non-resident) at the Hudson Institute, explained the importance of QUAD to stand against China’s expansionism, saying, “At the same time this region is under threat from China’s domination. When we compare Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific, we can find one feature. The Indo-Pacific includes all countries which have the problem with China, specially the border problem. That’s why the Indo-Pacific find it easier to deal with China. Shinzo Abe introduced the concept of Indo-Pacific in Quad, which is a group of great powers in the Indo-Pacific, excluding China. That’s why the Indo-Pacific in the Quad is important as a concept to deal with China.” China’s expansionist agenda was established in 2013 by President Xi Jinping with the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, BRI. To date, a total of 147 countries have signed on to BRI projects or indicated an interest in doing so. However, many of these countries are now concerned that China is using BRI funds to gain influence and control and that they are falling into a debt trap. (Source: Council on Foreign Relations) Beijing’s expansionism is not only a threat to its neighbours, but the entire Indo-Pacific region and other countries. India’s efforts to contain China will not only benefit India and her citizens but the broader Indo-Pacific region as well"

Though Indian government has refused to take sides in the war, calling for its end but effectively it has been on Russia’s side being one of its biggest customers of cheap crude oil that is being refined and exported to Europe, becoming a bigger exporter that Saudi Arabia . What’s more Europe happily and knowingly buys it, effectively showcasing its hypocrisy. Anyways Ukraine has been trying too hard ever since to get at India for giving tacit support to Russia. But India has always ignored Ukrainian blabbering’s over India’s support to Russia. However, fact is not just Indian government but by and large most of the Indian public too has always stood beside Russia, as they never forget how Russia helped India when the West/Europe actually tried to give pains on various matters. Ukraine on various public forums and on one-to-one interactions has requested for Indian support against Russia, but India politely turned those requests down, even when Ukrainian ministers came to India and literally begged for help. Although many Indians have supported Ukraine against Russia. But 2 days back Ukraine did something callous, blasphemous, and shocking; after which it can safely be said that whatever support Ukraine had for itself in India, with this act it has PISSED OFF everyone in India, and the support is gone kaput and for good. What actually happened is that Ukraine smarting at the loss of Crimea conducted a drone strike at an oil tanker facility at Sevastopol, the main Russian military base in Crimea on 28th or 29th of April, 2023. The drone strike caused a few of the oil tankers to go up in flames and create huge plumps of smoke that rose hundreds of feet in the air and could be seen from miles away. But what happened next was truly SHOCKING!!! In their excitement to celebrate the attack Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense tweeted a so-called meme from its official twitter account the huge cloud of smoke (top pic, left) and then compared it with the picture of Goddess Kali (top pic, right); but what shockedand left everyone in India angry is that Ukraine actually tried to imitate/paste an iconic pose of Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe on that picture. It was something Indians never expected Ukraine to do, as Goddess Kalibeing one of the most sacred, revered and worshipped goddesses of India is a symbol of power and strength. But to liken it with an iconic pose of a Hollywood actress was well and truly blasphemous. Immediately after the Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense tweeted the so-called meme, there was a huge hue and cry on social media especially Twitter from not just India but also abroad by people who revered Goddess Kali that Ukraine has crossed a sacred line and asked them to apologize and delete it. After much dilly-dallying Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense finally deleted the picture/meme but is yet to apologize. No matter what the it does now, the damage has been done and it is well and truly permanent. Whatever little support Ukraine had for itself from Indians is now well and truly gone, and no amount of apology can help Ukraine win it back.

As part of this initiative, Indian industries are now being invited to create repair and overhaul facilities for western-origin aircraft. The move is expected to enhance the country’s defense capabilities, as well as provide an opportunity for local businesses to develop their technical expertise. To evaluate the infrastructure and capabilities of interested parties, a capability assessment is currently underway. This assessment will help determine the suitability of the companies to undertake repair and overhaul work for western-origin aircraft. The initiative comes at a crucial time, as maintenance support contracts for some western-origin aircraft are set to finish. This will put foreign suppliers who had promised to transfer repair and overhaul facilities to India at the time of purchase to the test. The Chinook, Apache, and C 130J transport aircraft are among the western-origin aircraft that could potentially be part of the initiative. These aircraft have been important assets in India’s defense arsenal and ensuring that they are maintained and overhauled efficiently is crucial to their continued operational readiness. Overall, the initiative to develop repair and overhaul facilities for western-origin aircraft in India is a significant step towards achieving the country’s goals of self-reliance and indigenization in the defense sector. It also provides an opportunity for local businesses to develop their technical capabilities, and contribute to the growth of the country’s manufacturing sector."

Pakistan violates FATF redline by letting JeM seek funds for jihad,https://idrw.org/pakistan-violates-fatf-redline-by-letting-jem-seek-funds-for-jihad/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: ANI An UN-proscribed global terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), openly sought funds for jihad in Peshawar and other cities during the Eid celebrations. By letting this happen, Pakistan has violated a key redline set by the global anti-terrorist financing watchdog, FATF, in letting the country off the greylist last year, European Times reported. According to local residents, members of JeM were reportedly seeking funds for carrying out jihad in Kashmir and Palestine in Bagh-e-Naran, a suburb on the outskirts of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in April this year. Several Pakistani Twitter users have since pointed out that similar fundraising activities by extremist groups were happening in other areas as well. Many of them said these fund-raisings had been a regular feature at many mosques, sometimes under the protection of security personnel. There were other Twitter statements showing terrorist groups openly seeking funds in mosques in Karachi, European Times reported. The Eid fundraising by JeM clearly proves that Pakistan has failed to keep its promise to FATF to curtail terrorist funding. According to European Times, in June 2021, FATF declined to let off Pakistan from the greylist citing laxity in taking action against proscribed terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT), JeM and similar entities. The FATF said that despite completing 26 of the 27 tasks it had been handed, Pakistan’s failure to complete the last task on convicting terrorists and terror entities meant it would not be delisted for now. The same group is now freely seeking funds for terrorist activities. In fact, JeM had been active even as Pakistan was freed of sanctions by FATF last year. European Times reported that the JeM carried out large-scale construction at its sprawling Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah headquarters in Bahawalpur. Pakistan had claimed in its testimonies before FATF that JeM had been banned since 2002, within months of the group’s attack on the Parliament House in New Delhi in 2001. The group, with the aid of the Pakistan Army, had moved to Afghanistan to supplement the Afghan Taliban fighting the US-led forces. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitors reporting in May 2022 stated that JeM operated eight training camps in Nangarhar, three under Taliban control. The JeM has a long tie-up with the Afghan Taliban. When JeM leader, Masood Azhar, was freed after the Indian Airlines hijacking incident in December 1999, he was welcomed and given shelter by the Afghan Taliban leadership in Kandahar, European Times reported. Fundraising by jihadi groups during Eid was a common practice in the recent past. Since greater scrutiny came to bear on such terrorist fundraising, Pakistan had restricted such events but never stopped. Terrorist groups have been using devious methods to carry out such activities recently, European Times reported."
Russian oil exports to India reach milestone,https://idrw.org/russian-oil-exports-to-india-reach-milestone/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: RUSSIA TODAY Shipments during April of Russian crude oil to India have, for the first time ever, exceeded the combined oil-supply to New Delhi of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing data from energy-cargo tracker Vortexa. Exports of Russian crude to India during the period amounted to 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd), compared to 812,000 bpd imported by the South Asian nation from Iraq and 671,000 bpd of Saudi Arabian oil it bought. The data reveals a steady increase in India’s imports of Russian crude. In March, they amounted to 1.7 million bpd, with Moscow’s share of New Delhi’s oil imports reaching 34%, double the figure for Iraq, traditionally India’s top supplier. In contrast, Russian oil supplies to India totaled just 69,000 bpd (25 times less) in March 2022. They saw a month-over-month increase to 270,000 bpd in the following month. Overall volumes of oil supplies from Russia are expected to remain steady in May, according to Serena Huang, an analyst at Vortexa, as cited by the agency.

Chinese FM Qin Gang to visit India to attend meeting of SCO foreign ministers,https://idrw.org/chinese-fm-qin-gang-to-visit-india-to-attend-meeting-of-sco-foreign-ministers/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang will travel to India to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting being held in Goa on May 4 and 5, the foreign ministry here announced on Tuesday. Qin will attend the upcoming SCO Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Panaji, the announcement said. The SCO consists of China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India holds the presidency of the grouping for this year. At the SCO Foreign Ministers meeting, Qin will exchange views with other counterparts on the international and regional situation and cooperation among the member states in various fields, besides other topics, to make full preparation for this year’s SCO summit, the statement said. This will be Qin’s second visit to India after he took charge as the Foreign Minister. In early March, he visited India to take part in the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting during which he also held talks with External Affairs Minister SJaishankar on the current round of India-China tensions over the Chinese military actions in eastern Ladakh in May 2020, leading to a four-year standoff. In his meeting with Qin, Jaishankar had said the state of India-China ties is “abnormal” and there are real problems in the bilateral ties which needed to be open and candid dialogue. “It’s our first meeting after he took over as foreign minister. We spent maybe about 45 minutes talking to each other and the bulk of our conversation, understandably, was about the current state of our relationship, which many of you have heard me describe as abnormal,” Jaishankar told reporters after he met with Qin on March 2. “And those were among the adjectives that I used in that meeting. There are real problems in that relationship that need to be looked at, that need to be discussed very openly and candidly between us,” he had said. After that, the two sides held the 18th round of Corps Commanders level talks to resolve the eastern Ladakh standoff. Qin’s visit to India was followed by Chinese Defence Minister, Li Shangfu’s visit to New Delhi to attend the SCO Ministers meeting on April 27 during which he held talks with his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh. In his meeting with Li, Singh said that China’s violation of border agreements “eroded” the entire basis of ties between the two countries and that all issues relating to the frontier must be resolved in accordance with the existing pacts. For his part, Gen Li maintained that the situation at the India-China border is “generally stable” and both sides should put the frontier issue in an “appropriate position” and promote its transition to “normalised management”. Before travelling to India, Qin will visit Myanmar starting Tuesday. The visit to Myanmar is aimed to further follow through on the outcomes of President Xi Jinping’s visit to the country in January 2020, deepen practical cooperation in such fields as economy and livelihood, and support Myanmar’s efforts to maintain stability, revitalize the economy, improve people’s lives, and realise sustainable development, an official statement here said."
"India, China propose ‘multiple pathways’ on cutting use of fossil fuels: Report",https://idrw.org/india-china-propose-multiple-pathways-on-cutting-use-of-fossil-fuels-report/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: REUTERS India, backed by China, is trying to build a consensus within the G20 group to let countries choose a roadmap to cut carbon emissions instead of setting a deadline to end the use of fossil fuels, three Indian government officials said. India, the current G20 president, is keen on introducing the phrase ‘multiple energy pathways’ in a communique to be released at a group summit in September and has been supported by countries including China and South Africa, one of the officials said. The three officials declined to be identified since they were not authorised to speak to media. Multiple pathways for energy transition would enable countries to choose resources, even coal, while working towards plans on net zero emissions. At a meeting of the G20 Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG) in the western state of Gujarat last month, India opposed a deadline proposed by rich nations to end the use of coal, said the official who was at the meeting. Coal accounts for nearly three-fourths of India’s annual electricity generation, according to government data, and New Delhi has long defended its use of the fuel, citing lower emissions per capita, compared to other countries. China supported India during the meeting, saying it cannot put a timeline on ending fossil fuel dependence and would want to put ‘all’ its available resources to optimum use, the official said. The two countries are the top two consumers of coal in the world. China’s foreign affairs and environment ministries did not respond to queries sent by Reuters. The Indian power ministry declined comment. The ministries of environment and renewable energy did not respond. Climate ministers from the Group of Seven wealthy nations agreed last month “to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels so as to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest”. Officials said it was the first time India used the phrase ‘multiple pathways’ in global climate negotiations against repeated demands by Western nations to end coal usage. A second official said the phrase is in conformity with the 2015 Paris Agreement on combating climate change that favours “common but differentiated responsibilities, under different national circumstances”. He said rich countries overlook this while asking for the exit from coal. “A dominant view was seen emerging on every country to have individual pathways to achieve their national commitments and endowments,” a third official who attended the meeting said. Faced with calls to phase down the use of coal at the last climate change deliberations in Egypt in November 2022, India said all fossil fuels should be phased out including natural gas. At the G20 meeting last month, India kept the focus on fossil fuels, rather than singling out coal, the third official said. India and China, the world’s two most populous countries, have often taken common positions at international climate change negotiations, despite long-standing border disputes. In March, the European Union agreed to promote a global fossil fuel phase out ahead of the COP28 summit in Dubai in November. Delhi will host a summit of G20 leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, in September. Officials are meeting in the run-up to that meeting to finalise the group’s position on global issues including climate change. The G20 includes the G7 countries as well as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, among other nations."
G20: Responsibilities of the people of PoK,https://idrw.org/g20-responsibilities-of-the-people-of-pok/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: ANI As the G20 meeting in Kashmir approaches this month, increased hue and cry against India from neighbouring Pakistan has plunged to new levels. This is backed by several terror attacks in Poonch, Rajouri. “We, the people of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) have certain things we must be aware of and therefore accept some responsibilities,” said Dr Amjad Ayub Mirza, a human rights activist from Mirpur in PoK. Currently, India holds the presidency of the G20. The decision to hold several sessions of the G20 in Kashmir Valley, a Muslim-majority union territory, is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s ultimate demonstration of the conventions of equality, so dear to Sanatan dharma, and the cultural traditions of inclusivity, which Bharat has been demonstrating unceasingly from the time when Arab Muslims, who were direct decedents of Prophet Muhammed, escaped persecution of the Umayyad Caliphate and took refuge in Sindh where Dahir, a Hindu raja, gave them sanctuary, Mirza said. The decision of the BJP government to host G20 meeting in Kashmir has laid to rest the vile propaganda disseminated by Pakistan through its ISPR-controlled media and ISI-approved diplomats that the current Indian government is maligning Muslims and other minorities and enforcing a Hindutva agenda upon them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team have decisively placed Jammu and Kashmir on the business map of the world. This is good news for all those who belong to the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir including PoK. Any act that promotes a positive image of Jammu and Kashmir, in the final analysis, will benefit the people of the union territory and that includes those who are living under the occupation of Pakistan in PoK since October 22, 1947. Any trade policies that are decided during the G20 meeting in Jammu and Kashmir will have an effect on the union territory. Financial regulation will be revised and that will help to get rid of unnecessary red tape and obsolete business regulations that have hampered the development of Jammu and Kashmir in particular, and India in general, before the abrogation of articles 370 and 35-A, he said. The G20 meeting will bring an opportunity for Jammu and Kashmir to expand its trade and investment on a global scale. Tourism and handicraft industry will flourish even more due to G20 meeting to be held in Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir will become a global flash point and for the first time for the right reasons. Trade, sustainable development, energy, environment, agriculture and health sectors, only few to mention, will benefit hugely from the G20 meeting in Jammu and Kashmir. One might argue that it is a very ambitious step taken by the BJP government, but then folks, what else, if not for taking bold initiatives and ambitious strides is Prime Minister Modi acknowledged for? The G20 meeting in Kashmir is a great opportunity for us who are living under the illegal occupation of Pakistan to become part of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As citizens of PoK, we must share some responsibilities to help the G20 meeting run its course smoothly from May 22 to 24. One responsibility we must embrace boldly is to defeat the anti-G20 propaganda Pakistani and their facilitators propagate in PoK, which they have unleashed through local and national media. The way to do that is to hold public meetings in neighbourhoods of PoK, convene meetings in colleges and universities, encourage discussions among the government employees and every section of PoK society and explain the difference between the oppression we face and the development and prosperity Kashmir endures as part of the Union of the Republic of India. Another responsibility we must shoulder is that of identifying terrorist launch pads and be vigilant regarding their movement and report it on social media outlets or send information to me, and I will make sure that they are broadcasted on our erstwhile Radio Himalaya. We must use the opportunity of the G20 meeting to show the people of Jammu and Kashmir living on the other side of the Line of Control that we as a people are one people and that no matter how many dirty games or conspiracies Pakistan and its military try to hatch against us, we will not be divided. Let us not forget that the twenty member countries of G20 and scores of delegates from observer countries will not be able to ignore our strife and this time around the issue of PoK occupation and liberation will definitely come up in private conversations during the session of G20 meeting in Jammu and Kashmir. By holding the G20 meeting in Jammu and Kashmir, Narendra Modi has finally transformed PoK occupation into a global issue that the world community will not be able to ignore for much longer. Let us grab this opportunity and set the scene for our liberation from Pakistan and reunion with Mother India. Dr Amjad Ayub Mirza is an author and a human rights activist from Mirpur in PoK. He currently lives in the UK in exile."

Indian Navy’s S5 program and P76 get priority over SSN Program,https://idrw.org/indian-navys-s5-program-and-p76-get-priority-over-ssn-program/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG The Indian sea-based deterrent force is prioritizing the development of its ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) to reinforce its nuclear triad. With two Arihant-class submarines already operational and two stretched S4 and S4* (Star) submarines nearing completion, the focus has now shifted to the larger S5-class submarines that are currently in the advanced stages of development. The goal is to strengthen India’s nuclear capabilities and maintain a robust sea-based deterrent force. India’s top priority remains the S5 program, which aims to develop a 13,000-ton displacement SSBN. While construction on the stretched S4 and S4* submarines nears completion, funding and efforts are being directed towards the ongoing S5 program so that the first submarine is introduced by 2031-32. According to sources familiar with the matter, IDRW has learned that the Indian Navy intends to support the development of P75I and P76 by investing procurement of six next-generation conventional submarines, followed by 12 locally designed conventional submarines. These initiatives have taken priority over the development of indigenous nuclear-powered attack submarines. Although the P75I program has been delayed, the Indian Navy remains interested in procuring essential components for its submarine program from foreign suppliers as the Navy intends to acquire these vital components before commencing construction of the submarines under the P76 program. The P76 program entails the purchase of 12 diesel-electric submarines with AIP technology, and the preliminary design stage is expected to be completed by 2025. Plans to acquire three indigenous nuclear-powered attack submarines locally might be now further pushed to around 2035 as work on initial design is likely to complete only by 2026-27 with construction taking around 7-8 years before the first submarine is ready for sea trials around 2035."

Kumar directed the officials to ensure that the security arrangements are put in place well before the summit, and the deployment of security personnel should be done in a manner that does not cause inconvenience to the local residents and tourists. He also emphasised the need to be vigilant and take pre-emptive measures to prevent any untoward incident during the summit. He further advised them that additional security measures should be placed at the vulnerable locations to avoid any untoward incident during the G20 summit."
Bangladesh President Seeks India’s Assistance Over Rohingya Crisis,https://idrw.org/bangladesh-president-seeks-indias-assistance-over-rohingya-crisis/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: PTI Newly-elected President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Tuesday urged India to take more effective steps in persuading Myanmar to take back the Rohingyas who were forced to take refuge in Bangladesh to evade persecution in the neighbouring country. “The President made the request when Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Kumar Verma met him at Bangabhaban,” a presidential palace spokesman. President Shahabuddin, 73, was sworn in as the 22nd president of Bangladesh on April 24. He succeeded Abdul Hamid whose tenure ended on April 23. Verma paid a courtesy call on President Shahabuddin and conveyed to him warm greetings from President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed recent bilateral developments, the Indian High Commission in Dhaka tweeted. During the meeting, President Shahabuddin said that Bangladesh has sheltered the Muslim ethnic minority community for humanitarian reasons, and their prolonged stay is creating problems not only for the South Asian country but for the entire region, in an apparent reference to the escalating security risks including terrorism. Nearly one million Rohingya Muslims fled a crackdown by Myanmar’s military in 2017 in Rakhine state and are living in camps in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. India has always called for the sustainable and speedy return of displaced persons to the Rakhine state of Myanmar. India has worked with Bangladesh and Myanmar to resolve this issue. Shahabuddin said Bangladesh attaches highest importance to its relations with India which is so closely linked by geographical proximity, shared history and sacrifices. He termed the existing bilateral ties as “strong and unique”. Shahabuddin, himself a Liberation War veteran, also recalled the training he received during his stay in India in 1971 during the independence struggle. He said the prime ministers of Bangladesh and India recently visited each others’ capitals and their “visits have opened a new chapter in the relationship between the two countries”. Shahabuddin said Bangladesh gave India access to Chittagong and Mongla seaport for transporting goods from the mainland to its north-eastern states. He expected the move would significantly cut time and cost needed to transport goods to India’s northeastern states and West Bengal and push regional connectivity in Bay of Bengal. He also noted that Dhaka and Delhi signed the ACMP (Chittagong and Mongla Port) agreement in 2018 and the deal would accelerate the socio-economic development of the two countries along with the increase in trade and commerce. The President hoped that the two countries’ unresolved issues, including the water distribution agreement, would be resolved soon through mutual cooperation and discussion. The high commissioner said India attaches highest importance to the relationship with Bangladesh. “Connectivity between the two countries has grown tremendously in the last one and a half decades. As a result, the people of both countries are enjoying its benefits,” Verma added. “The connectivity between the two countries has increased manifold over the last 15 years. People of both countries are enjoying this.” The Indian envoy informed his country’s appreciation for Bangladesh’s “Zero Tolerance Policy” against terrorism and said it resulted in stability in the region which is contributing positively to the economic development of both countries."
4 Pilots Injured After Drone Explosion In Chhattisgarh,https://idrw.org/4-pilots-injured-after-drone-explosion-in-chhattisgarh/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: ANI Four drone pilots suffered burn injuries and two pilots are still in a critical condition after an Idea Forge Drone exploded in Chhattisgarh’s Raigarh, an official statement said. The explosion took place around 8 pm on April 27 when a team of 4 pilots were trying to recharge the Idea Forge drone battery for the government Swamitva mapping scheme project, officials said. “We have been in the industry for more than a decade and it’s the first time an incident of this nature has been reported to us and is really unfortunate,” the official statement said. “The details of the incident are being ascertained at this stage. Our manufacturing facility is equipped with high-quality testing equipment and our UAVs undergo stringent quality checks before it is delivered to the customer. While we are always cautious and inform all our clients on how to take care of their UAVs. In light of this incident, we will be reiterating and issuing additional SOPs for our customers,” said an official statement from Idea Forge Technology Ltd. Idea Forge is one of the leading drone manufacturers in India having supplied drones to the Indian defence forces & the Q6 drone recently received the type certification from the DGCA. Superintendent of Police (SP) Raigarh has taken cognisance of the incident and told ANI, “We have sent our officers to investigate the matter and file its detailed report.” On the complaint of drone explosion and injuries, the SP confirmed that the four pilots of the drone have been admitted to the local hospital, but refrained from saying how serious the injuries were as the matter is under the supervision of doctors. The injured pilots belong to Navbharat Explosive Pvt Ltd. (Flying Tech Services) and company officials are in shock after the incident. “Our first priority is to provide better medical facilities to our employees. Have collected all the evidence for submission to the concerned authority,” the official said. Drone explosion not only affects Idea Forge IPO plans but also impacts the safety drone industry in the long run, officials said. Smit Shah, president of the Drone Federation of India (DFI), a drone industry body, reacted to the drone blast and said, “Problems with lithium batteries are becoming an issue across sectors like phones, electric vehicles and now drones.” He said that it is becoming important for manufacturers to further enhance battery-related SOPs and educate customers and for customers to ensure that batteries are being handled as per SOPs specified by the manufacturer. “We will recommend it to all drone manufacturers in India to ensure that the level of safety in the drone ecosystem keeps improving,” he said. Meanwhile, a complaint has been lodged with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and an investigation has also started."
Government to bring new LAW to Fastrack development near LAC and LOC,https://idrw.org/government-to-bring-new-law-to-fastrack-development-near-lac-and-loc/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: UNI The Indian government is proposing changes to the Forest Act of 1980 through the Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill, 2023, which was presented in the Lok Sabha on March 29. Many infrastructure projects with strategic and military significance along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan have been delayed due to the Forest Act. To avoid such delays, the defence ministry is advocating for exemptions for the entire sweep along the LAC and the LoC, up to 100 km from the border, from the Forest Act’s purview. The proposed law seeks to provide a waiver from the “green norms” in the interest of national security. The Border road construction and related infrastructure projects have become critical for making the Indian military more operationally agile on the borders. However, any construction activity in the heavily forested LAC-LoC stretch requires permission from relevant authorities and adherence to “green norms.” The proposed bill seeks exemptions for construction of a strategic linear project of national importance and related to national security up to 100 km from the LAC and the LoC, defence-related projects or camps for paramilitary forces or public utility projects up to 10 hectares, and projects up to 5 hectares in a Left Wing Extremism affected area, as notified by the Central Government. The exemption, however, is subject to certain conditions such as undertaking tree plantations to compensate for the felling of trees that may have been undertaken to build the roads or set up infrastructure projects. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, requires prior permission from the Central Government for the diversion of reserved forests, use of forest land for non-forest purposes, assigning of forest land by way of lease, and other activities. Since forests fall under the concurrent list of the constitution, the government’s final approval for the infrastructure project also requires the respective state’s approval, leading to delays. The proposed amendment to the existing forest law aims to expedite infrastructure projects that are essential from a security perspective. In 2014, the then Arunachal Pradesh Governor had pointed out that China had built roads that almost touch the LAC, while most of the Indian road-heads peter off at least about 50-70 km from the LAC, making such infrastructure projects crucial for India’s national security."

Motu Ram Mandavi alias Manoj Mandavi, the commander of the Naxal local organisational squad (LOS), surrendered before Narayanpur Superintendent of Police (SP) Pushkar Sharma, he said. Mandavi, a resident of Marameta village in Bhairamgarh police station of Bijapur district, was involved in Maoist activities since 2009 and had played a crucial role in executing three incidents of violence, SP Sharma said. He was allegedly involved in the murder of a villager in Kachhapal village in 2010 and two ambush attacks on security forces at Kodaliyar Michpara and Kutul Michingpara in 2013, he said. Mandavi was recruited into the Balanar Militia in 2009. Subsequently, he joined Company Number 9 (also known as NIB Company) in 2010 and has since been serving as a commander in the LOS, he said. Disenchanted with the ideology and meaningless violence, Mandavi decided to shun the Naxalite path. He was also impressed by the Chhattisgarh government’s rehabilitation policy, the official said. Mandavi used to carry a 12 bore and an SLR gun and has surrendered with weapons, he added. The surrendered Naxalite will be provided all the benefits and facilities provisioned under the rehabilitation policy and will receive immediate financial assistance of Rs 10,000, the SP said."

The Punjab-origin affiliate of Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang is wanted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police after India obtained an Interpol Red Notice for Brar in June 2022, the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi said in a statement. Brar’s life-sized cutout among all 25 fugitives has been displayed at Toronto’s Yonge-Dundas Square, according to the Bolo (Be On the Lookout) Programme’ list issued. The 29-year-old is accused of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and illegal arms trafficking in India. However, there is no reward for Goldy Brar, who features on the 15th number in the list. Brar, who reached Canada on a student visa in 2017, allegedly claimed responsibility for the murder of Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, popularly known as Sidhu Moosewala, who was shot dead in Punjab’s Mansa district on May 29, 2022. Brar is accused of committing these crimes while being in Canada and is currently under investigation, but is not charged with any criminal offences in Canada, the statement said. Goldy Brar, who belongs to Punjab’s Muktsar, has been on the run since then. Interpol notices are international requests for cooperation or alerts allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information. In the case of Red Notices, the persons concerned are wanted by national jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest warrant or court decision. In Canada, an Interpol Red Notice does not provide police the authority to arrest a person. An individual may only be arrested if reasonable probable grounds exist that the individual has committed a crime in Canada, or if a Canadian arrest warrant has been issued. The offences Brar allegedly committed in India are very serious in nature and merit the interest of the police in Canada, the statement said, adding that “Brar is believed to be in Canada and represents a risk to public safety”. The Punjab Police have blamed Goldy Brar and gangster Lawrence Bishnoi for the killing of Moosewala. Bishnoi, who continues to remain in jail after his arrest in 2015, has been operating his terror-crime syndicate from prisons in different states, along with Canada-based Goldy Brar, who is also an accused in the killing of ‘Dera Sacha Sauda’ follower Pradeep Kumar at Faridkot (Punjab) in November 2022. Goldy Brar has been named in the 1,850-page police charge sheet filed in the Mansa court on August 26 last year. Jailed gangsters Bishnoi and Jaggu Bhagwanpuria have also been named in the chargesheet alongside a dozen others. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by Anti-Gangster Task Force chief Pramod Ban is probing the killing of Moosewala. Ban has said Bishnoi, the main conspirator, confessed that the execution planning was hatched in August 2021 to avenge the murder of Akali youth leader Middukhera."

DRDO conducts Design Validation Trial of Vertical Shaft based Underground Ammunition Storage Structure,https://idrw.org/drdo-conducts-design-validation-trial-of-vertical-shaft-based-underground-ammunition-storage-structure/,"May 2, 2023","SOURCE: PIB Centre of Fire, Explosive and Environment Safety (CFEES), a Delhi-based laboratory of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has designed and developed a Vertical Shaft based Underground Ammunition Storage Facility. It enables upward vertical dissipation of blast effects considerably reducing the blast effect on surrounding utilities. The Design Validation Trial of this Underground Ammunition Storage Structure was successfully conducted on April 30, 2023. The instrumented blast trial was carried out in presence of the Armed Forces by detonating 5,000 kgs of TNT in one of the chambers of the underground facility. The CFEES team conducted the trial with precision and utmost safety in place. All the parameters recorded during the trial matched with estimated values. This facility will ensure that an explosion within will not cause damage to the adjacent chamber and also ensuring full operability of the remaining facility. The Armed Forces find it difficult to stock ammunition as required by them due to non- availability of adequate land as large safety distances are required for ammunition storage structures. The safety distances considerably reduce, when ammunition is stored underground. Based on the results of the instrumented trials, the safety distance has been established up to 120 Metric Ton (40 Metric Ton Net Explosive Content) ammunition storage per chamber. The unique design developed has an additional advantage of reducing Safety Distances and Cost by 50 per cent as compared to current designs. The design also ensures higher safety of ammunition stored from any kind of aerial attack or sabotage. Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO has congratulated the teams involved in the successful instrumented blast trial and stated that the facility can be extensively used by the Armed Forces for storage of all types of ammunition reducing the land footprint requirements in addition to providing enhanced safety of ammunition against aerial attacks or sabotage.."

The Fast Patrol Vessel, capable of coastal and offshore surveillance at high speeds, was commissioned as MNDF Coast Guard ship Huravee. President of Maldives Mr Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and Defence Minister Ms Mariya Ahmed Didi were present on the occasion. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh described the handing over of the two ‘Made in India’ platforms as a symbol of the shared commitment of India and the Maldives towards peace and security in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). He stated that India, through a robust defence ecosystem, has significantly enhanced its manufacturing capabilities to further support the capacity building of partner countries. “India has emerged as a leading defence exporter in recent years. A defence manufacturing ecosystem has been created which has the advantage of abundant technical manpower. We produce world-class equipment to meet not only our own needs, but also for exports. India offers an enhanced defence partnership to friendly foreign countries, that is accommodative of their national priorities and capacities. We wish to create symbiotic relationships where we can learn from each other, grow together and create a win-win situation for all. India’s commitment to support the Maldives will only get stronger with time,” the Raksha Mantri said. On India’s strong defence cooperation with the nation, Shri Rajnath Singh asserted that the ties emanate from the twin policies of ‘Neighbourhood First’ and ‘SAGAR’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region). He recalled Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to the Maldives in June 2019, during which he emphasised that “‘Neighbourhood First’ is our priority and in the neighbourhood, ‘Maldives is priority’.” The Raksha Mantri called for enhanced cooperation among nations in the IOR to address the common challenges faced by the region. “The Indian Ocean is our shared space. The primary responsibility for peace, stability and prosperity in the region rests with those who live in the region. Peace and security of a region are best secured with cooperation and collaboration of the regional players,” he said. Shri Rajnath Singh identified sustainable exploitation of resources and climate change as the most important common challenges faced by the IOR. He called for collaborative efforts towards ensuring that the maritime expanse of the Indian Ocean is peaceful and the resources are optimally harnessed for regional prosperity. Sustainable exploitation of maritime resources is an important means for sustained growth and development of nations across the IOR, he said. On climate change, the Raksha Mantri said, it has a huge impact on the maritime environment and its effects can pose challenges for taking forward national and regional aspirations. Pointing out that the Maldives is particularly exposed to the vagaries of climate change, he voiced India’s willingness to work with its neighbour for adaptation and mitigation. “India has been the first responder in a large number of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) requirements in the region in the past many years. We look forward to building upon each other’s expertise by collaborative engagement,” he said. Earlier in the day, Shri Rajnath Singh called on Maldivian President Mr Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Discussions were held on ongoing projects and ways to further strengthen defence ties. The Maldivian President expressed gratitude for India’s continued aid and support to the Maldives in various sectors, stating that it is a testament to New Delhi’s special regard for the nation. He also conveyed the Maldives’ commitment towards strengthening this relationship. The Raksha Mantri spoke about the progress of various developmental projects undertaken by India in the Maldives and assured continued support. Shri Rajnath Singh reached Male on May 01, 2023. On the first day of his engagements, he held talks with his Maldivian counterpart and Foreign Minister of Maldives Mr Abdulla Shahid."
US commission seeks sanctions on Indian agencies over ‘violation’ of religious freedom,https://idrw.org/us-commission-seeks-sanctions-on-indian-agencies-over-violation-of-religious-freedom/,"May 2, 2023","SOURCE: PTI A federal US commission has urged the Biden administration to impose targeted sanctions on Indian government agencies and officials responsible for “severe violations” of religious freedom in the country by freezing their assets. The US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) also recommended to the Congress to raise the issue of religious freedom during US-India bilateral meetings, and hold hearings on it. In its annual report on religious freedom, the USCIRF asked the US State Department to designate India as a “country of particular concern” on the status of religious freedom along with several other nations. The USCIRF has been making similar recommendations to the State Department since 2020, which have not been accepted so far. The recommendations of USCIRF are not mandatory for the State Department. In its India section of the report, USCIRF alleged that in 2022, religious freedom conditions in India continued to worsen. Throughout the year, the Indian government at the national, state, and local levels promoted and enforced religiously discriminatory policies, including laws targeting religious conversion, interfaith relationships, the wearing of hijabs, and cow slaughter, which negatively impact Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Dalits, and Adivasis (indigenous peoples and scheduled tribes). “The national government also continued to suppress critical voices — particularly religious minorities and those advocating on their behalf — including through surveillance, harassment, demolition of property, and detention under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and by targeting nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA),” the USCIRF alleged. Responding to questions, State Department’s Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that USCIRF is not a branch of the State Department, or the Executive Branch, and its report reflects the importance of religious freedom to the American people. “While the report’s recommendations for designations overlap to some extent with the State Department’s lists of countries of particular concern, it is not entirely conclusive. Governments or other entities that have questions or comments about this report should reach out to the Commission directly,” Patel said. US-based non-profit organisation, Foundation of Indian and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) slammed the USCIRF for its “biased” report. “While the USCIRF is predictably attempting to revive its annual case against India for inclusion in the CPC, it does so with a weaker set of data points that are predictably filled with both omission and commission,” Khanderao Kand of FIIDS said in a statement. “It conveniently lists delays in court cases but conveniently omits the fact that the Assam High Court actually ordered the implementation of the NRC, not the government,” Kand said. Furthermore, the report fails to acknowledge the cultural and economic significance of cows to Indian villagers, not to mention the constitutional ban on cow slaughter. It conveniently ignores the fact that the bulldozed houses were illegal and notified, and the list of omissions goes on. Astonishingly, the USCIRF fails to mention the beheadings of Hindus and their targeted killings by jihadi Muslims in Kashmir, he said. “Moreover, there seems to be a biased agenda of USCIRF generalising isolated incidents without considering the complexities of India’s diverse population of 1.3 billion people. It is clear that the USCIRF’s renewed effort lacks the necessary objectivity and fairness, and it raises questions about their true intentions and credibility,” Kand said. The Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) welcomed the USCIRF’s decision to recommend that India be designated as a country of particular concern for the fourth consecutive year. “This decision reaffirms what IMAC has been saying for years that India’s government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has continued to systematically violate the religious freedom of minority communities, particularly Muslims and Christians,” said Rasheed Ahmed, IAMC executive director. “It is high time that the State Department acts on USCIRF’s recommendation and holds India accountable as the ground situation becomes increasingly more violent and dangerous for its religious minorities. We particularly welcome that the report highlights the systematic and appalling harassment of Journalists,” Ahmed said."

Lithium is a non-ferrous metal and is one of the key components in EV batteries, among other industries. “Geological Survey of India (GSI), an attached office of the Ministry of Mines, carried out a G3 stage mineral exploration project during Field Season 2020-21 and 2021-22 in Salal-Haimna areas of Reasi district, Jammu & Kashmir and estimated an inferred resource (G3) of 5.9 million tonnes of lithium ore and the report has been handed over to the Government of Union Territory of J&K,” the Ministry of Mines earlier said."
First test launch of new low-cost star sensor developed from off-the-shelf components successfully conducted,https://idrw.org/first-test-launch-of-new-low-cost-star-sensor-developed-from-off-the-shelf-components-successfully-conducted/,"May 2, 2023","SOURCE: PIB A new low-cost star sensor developed by astronomers from off-the-shelf components was recently launched by ISRO on board PSLV C-55. In its first-ever space test, the sensor, which is mounted on the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM), is performing well, and the initial data has now validated its design as well as its function. The StarBerrySense payload developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), was launched on 22 April. This novel low-cost sensor designed to quickly calculate where the satellite is pointing is being tested in space for the very first time. The astronomers from the Space Payloads Group at the institute have announced that not only has StarBerrySense withstood the harsh conditions in space and is functioning as expected, the initial data shows that it is able to calculate the pointing direction. For any space mission, it is crucial to know where the satellite is being pointed to at any given time. While there are several ways to do this, a star sensor provides the most accurate information about a spacecraft’s orientation. The start sensor designed by the Space Payloads Group at IIA is capable of finding its pointing direction in space by identifying the stars in its field of view. “This payload is built around the well-known minicomputer RaspberryPi, and the electronics and software were designed in-house,” said Bharat Chandra, the technical lead of the project and a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. “The advantage of this payload is that it is cost-effective, simple to build, and can be deployed on a wide variety of satellites,” he added. “StarBerrySense was mounted on ISRO’s PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM), which provides a stable platform for our payload to operate from. POEM is a unique initiative by ISRO that utilises the spent 4th stage of the PSLV as an orbital platform for carrying out scientific experiments. It is an excellent opportunity to conduct short-term scientific experiments in space,” said Rekhesh Mohan, the Principal Investigator of the StarBerrySense project. The primary objective was to assess its survivability and performance in space. “The flight qualification tests were done at the MGK Menon Laboratory for Space Sciences, located in the CREST campus of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics at Hosakote. Sky imaging tests were conducted at our Vainu Bappu Observatory”, said Binukumar, former visiting scientist at IIA and a member of the StarBerrySense team. “During the days following the launch, we have verified that StarBerrySense is performing as expected in space,” said Shubham Ghatul, a Ph.D. student in the team. The main function of StarBerrySense is to image the field of view, correctly identify the stars it sees, and calculate the pointing direction. Shubhangi Jain, a Ph.D. student in the team, said, “Analysis of the preliminary data has confirmed that the imaging equipment works as expected, and the onboard software is able to calculate the pointing direction.” “Using the images received from the payload, we are verifying its accuracy by comparing with data from international databases,” Mahesh Babu, an electronics engineer with the team, added. “Working with the PSLV team was a great learning experience for the whole team. Guidance and support from IN-SPACe was also invaluable in this successful venture,” added Rekhesh Mohan. The team also consisted of Margarita Safonova (DST Woman-Scientist) and Jayant Murthy (Visiting Professor)."

Kashmir getting ready to showcase its beauty to G20 delegates,https://idrw.org/kashmir-getting-ready-to-showcase-its-beauty-to-g20-delegates/,"May 2, 2023","SOURCE: ANI In its ongoing G20 meetings in various sectors, India will soon host a tourism working group meeting in Srinagar – the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir — in May. For the first time after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A, Jammu and Kashmir will be hosting an international event in which delegates from G20 member states, guest countries and several international organizations will participate. Kashmir is known for its breathtaking beauty. Naturally what could have been better to hold a tourism working group meeting other than Srinagar? By holding the meeting in Srinagar, India also wants to convey a strong message to the global community about the stability of the place. It wants to portray the peaceful ambience of the place. India took over the presidency of the G20 in December 2022. It is expected to host a total of 215 meetings across 55 locations this year. Some components of the ongoing smart city project in Srinagar have been tweaked, with contracts being reworked and deadlines advanced by a month or two, to have them completed ahead of a G20 tourism working group meeting to be held between May 22 and 24, reported The Economic Times. Around 50 delegates are expected to participate in the G-20 meeting in Srinagar, which will allow India to refute Pakistan’s claims of human rights violations in the Kashmir Valley. Indian officials and former diplomats said the G-20 presidency offers an opportunity to showcase New Delhi’s leading role in global affairs, particularly when the world is confronting multiple geopolitical and economic crises, reported DW.com. “This is proforma outrage by Pakistan. The reaction is unsurprising, given that the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement does not want to give reason to Imran Khan to question their Kashmir posture,” Ajay Bisaria, a former high commissioner to Pakistan told DW. “Pakistan would be well advised not to overhype the issue since that would only reduce its own diplomatic space. Jammu and Kashmir is a part of India,” former diplomat Meera Shankar told DW. “Its economy is tourism focused and the climate there is very pleasant in May when temperatures in the rest of India are very high. It is an appropriate venue to hold a tourism-related meeting.” Preparations for meetings are underway in Srinagar and adjoining areas. Foreign delegates will also be taken on a sightseeing tour to Baramulla, Dachigam National Park, and to the ski resort of Gulmarg. Jammu and Kashmir is also expecting an investment of Rs 75,000 crore in 2023. Pharmaceuticals, cold storage, food processing, packaging, logistics, medi-cities, educational institutions etc have shown a keen interest in setting up n units in J-K. Also, there are foreign investment proposals worth almost Rs 3,000 crore, including from the Lulu group, Times of India had reported earlier. In March, an Emirati property company announced a USD 60 million project to build a shopping mall and offices in Srinagar, reported ForeignPolicy.com. India has already held G-20 tourism meetings in the states of Gujarat and West Bengal earlier this year and has scheduled another in the state of Goa in June."

BrahMos to get a Mach bump to stay relevant,https://idrw.org/brahmos-to-get-a-mach-bump-to-stay-relevant/,"May 2, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG BrahMos Aerospace is currently working on the development of the Next-Generation BrahMos, which will be smaller and lighter but still capable of delivering the same powerful punch with a range of 300km at a speed of Mach 3.5 that can overwhelm any air defence system. Along with plans to develop a hypersonic BrahMos missile that can reach speeds of Mach 6-7 in collaboration with Russia, the company is also focused on improving the performance of the BrahMos to maintain its competitive edge. Since its first test in 2001 and subsequent production in 2004, BrahMos has undergone several improvements in range and capabilities. However, the speed of the supersonic cruise missile has remained around Mach 2.9 to this day. That is about to change. BrahMos Aerospace is currently focused on increasing the speed of its liquid ramjet engine beyond Mach 4 and reaching the Lower Hypersonic speed range, which is typically reserved for projectiles that can fly above Mach 5. The BrahMos missile maintains high speeds throughout its trajectory, making early interception more difficult. Its firing range is over the horizon, and it has fire-and-forget capabilities that simplify its use, enabling operators to quickly redeploy after firing without constant guidance. Additionally, the missile can follow various trajectories based on the nature of the target and anticipated defences. For instance, it can use a high-low trajectory that takes up to 14km in the air or a sea-skimming trajectory that makes it harder to detect by enemy warships. These capabilities greatly improve the missile’s versatility and effectiveness. However, as time passes, the missile may require increased speed to maintain its effectiveness. This is due to the emergence of new Interceptor technology that is possessed by only a few countries but may become more widespread in the future."

Myanmar’s Military Builds on Great Coco Island Raises Concerns of Chinese Involvement,https://idrw.org/military-construction-on-myanmars-great-coco-island-prompts-fears-of-chinese-involvement/,"May 2, 2023","SOURCE: UNI Myanmar’s Great Coco Island has been a topic of intrigue since the early 1990s, with rumors of a Chinese intelligence facility present on the island. Now, satellite images taken in January 2023 have revealed signs of military modernization, including a newly lengthened runway, radar station, hangars, and an accommodation block. The island’s location is strategically important, lying close to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, and 55km from India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which host Indian navy and air force bases. The construction on Great Coco has raised concerns that China, which Myanmar has become increasingly dependent on since the 2021 coup, could gain intelligence through espionage or intelligence sharing. Although the Maxar satellite images did not show any specific evidence of Chinese activity on Great Coco, the Myanmar military has sought closer ties with Beijing since the coup, supporting its claim to Taiwan and announcing its support for China’s “global security initiative.” China has invested heavily in Myanmar, including a major port at Kyaukphyu in western Myanmar, designed to give it access to the Indian Ocean for the transport of liquified gas and oil, allowing it to become less reliant on shipping resources through the crowded Strait of Malacca. The Chatham House report warns that the construction on Great Coco “presents a significant challenge to regional security and will likely generate significant tensions between China and India in the Bay of Bengal.” India reportedly confronted Myanmar with intelligence showing that Beijing was providing assistance in building a surveillance post on the island. Analysts believe Myanmar’s military is playing India and China off against one another in return for greater economic and diplomatic support, and Great Coco could be used as leverage in negotiations with Delhi. The international community must not ignore the crisis in Myanmar, given the implications for power dynamics in the region."

The agreement was signed by Ujjwal Kanti Bhattacharya, Director Projects, NTPC, and Ranjay Sharan, Director Projects, NPCIL, in the presence of RK Singh, Minister of Power, New & Renewable Energy, K N Vyas, Secretary of the department of atomic energy (DAE) and Chairman Atomic Energy Commission; Alok Kumar, Secretary, Ministry of Power; Gurdeep Singh, CMD NTPC; B C Pathak, CMD NPCIL and senior officials of the ministry of power and department of atomic energy. Union Minister of State for Atomic Energy and Space Jitendra Singh on April 5 this year informed the Rajya Sabha that it gave bulk approval for the installation of 10 nuclear reactors. In a statement laid on the floor of the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Atomic Energy and Space Jitendra Singh had said the Government has roped in PSUs for the installation of the nuclear reactors or the exercise would be done exclusively by the specialized Government agencies. The Government has accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for 10 indigenous Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors of 700 MW each in fleet mode. The minister also informed the Rajya Sabha that National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) have jointly manufactured an earth science satellite named, NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar). On April 5, Union Minister of State for Atomic Energy and Space Jitendra Singh informed the House that during 2021-22 nuclear power reactors generated 47112 million units of electricity, which comprises about 3.15 per cent of the total electricity generated in the country. In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on April 5, Jitendra Singh said, the present installed nuclear power capacity is set to increase from 6780 MW to 22480 MW by 2031 on progressive completion of projects under construction and accorded sanction. The Government has also accorded ‘in principle’ approval for new sites to set up nuclear reactors in future. On February 9, the department of atomic energy said India’s Nuclear Power capacity witnessed a quantum jump after 2014, when Narendra Modi took over as the Prime Minister. Going by the exact figures, during 2013-14 if the annual nuclear power generation stood at 35,333 million units, in the latest year of 2021-22 it stands at 47,112 million units which is nearly 30 to 40 per cent increase within a short span of over eight and a half years. This was stated in New Delhi by Union Minister of State for Atomic Energy and Space during a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on nuclear power reactors, on February 9, 2023. The Minister cited a number of path-breaking out-of-the-box decisions taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to supplement the rise of nuclear power generation in India. For example, he said, if there were only 22 reactors in the country before this government came in, the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Modi gave simultaneous bulk approval for as many as 11 indigenous pressurised heavy water reactors in 2017 at a total cost of Rs.1,05,000 crore and a total capacity of 7,000 megawatt, according to a statement from the department of atomic energy. Jitendra Singh also said in another revolutionary decision as was done in the case of the space department which was unlocked for private players, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also allowed joint ventures with Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) to augment India’s nuclear programme. Following a decision to this effect in 2015, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is present in two joint ventures one with National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) and the other with Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL)."

In August last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian President Solih kick-started the India-funded Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP), billed as the largest infrastructure initiative in the island nation. Under the project, a 6.74-km-long bridge and causeway link will be built to connect Male with the adjoining islands of Villingli, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi. The Maldives is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of India’s Neighbourhood First policy. Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane visited the Maldives in March and held talks with his Maldivian counterpart, Major General Abdulla Shamaal. Aramane is also accompanying Singh."

The Military Area within the Cantonment will be converted into a Military Station and the Civil Area will merge with the Municipality, according to sources. The Government published a notification to this effect on 27 April 2023. Contrary to perception, this move will prove beneficial to all alike. Civilians who were, until now, not getting access to State government welfare schemes through the Municipality, will now be in a position to avail these through the Municipality. As far as the Army is concerned, they too could now focus on the development of Military stations. This is a first among a series of excision of Cantts and is a move that has been welcomed by all. Cantts are deemed Municipalities and running Municipalities is a State subject. There were 56 Cantts at the time of Independence and six more were notified after 1947, the last one being Ajmer in 1962. Civilian residents of Cantts are not benefitted from State government welfare schemes since Cantts are governed by Cantt Boards through the Defence Estates Department of the Ministry of Defence. Hence, there is a popular demand from the civilian residents and state governments for the excision of Cantts. A considerable portion of the Defence Budget is spent on developing Civil Areas of Cantts. Due to the ever-increasing expansion of Civil Areas of Cantts, there is pressure on A1 Defence Land. Cantts are colonial phenomena and Military Stations are better administered. Cantt Board employees and assets will be taken over by the neighbouring municipality."

The F414 Enhanced Engine is capable of generating a 116kN thrust class while retaining the same length as the F414-INS6 engine at 154 inches, as well as the same inlet diameter. This enables an easy switch of the AMCA MkI fleet to the F414 Enhanced Engine without requiring major structural changes. Moreover, the F414 Enhanced Engine enables reverse compatibility, allowing other fighter jets such as the Tejas Mk2 and TEDBF to switch to the new 110-120kN engine easily when they are due for an engine change after 10 years into service. Based on the information provided to idrw, the Project Managers for AMCA and TEDBF have suggested that the GE engines should be retained. The reason for this is that choosing a different engine manufacturer would necessitate a reassessment of the air intake design and other parameters during integration, which could lead to further delays in the program."

According to information obtained by idrw, earlier this year Indian and French MOD officials discussed the possibility of French involvement in India’s Nuclear Attack submarine program as technical consultants. The discussions revolved around the integration of French-developed non-nuclear technologies, such as pump-jet propulsion, into Indian submarines. Propellers and pump-jets are crucial components of a submarine, with pump-jets offering superior efficiency across most of a submarine’s performance range. These components are also highly sensitive and play a key role in protecting the blade elements they contain. The Indian Navy has been working to develop pump-jet propulsion technology domestically, but progress has been limited so far. It is expected to take at least a decade or longer for India to develop a pump-jet propulsion system that meets the requirements of the nuclear attack submarine program that was approved in 2016. India plans to develop three nuclear attack submarines building upon the prior work done for two Arihant class ballistic missile submarines. However, unlike slow-moving SSBNs, nuclear attack submarines need to have fast acceleration speed and on-demand propulsion for covert operations. Two key components, pump-jet propulsion technology and fine-tuned nuclear reactors capable of generating power for short durations, will be required to achieve this. The Indian Navy is expected to consider incorporating pump-jet propulsion technology into its Conventional Diesel submarine program. The program aims to locally develop 12 submarines in the country, following the completion of Project-75I."

Dassault needs to be subcontracted to work on the program that will enable Rafale to operate Indian-made weapons systems like Astra and SAAW. While the Rafale is equipped with the Meteor Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile, the MICA air-to-air missiles are outdated and do not offer the same level of range and performance as the Indian-made Astra. MBDA is working on the Mica NG, which has a higher range and will replace the MICA medium-range missile, but it is not expected to be available before 2026. According to sources familiar with the matter, idrw has learned that requests to equip the Mirage-2000, Su-30MKI, and Tejas Mk1A with the Meteor missile were turned down. The Su-30MKI was declined due to its respective origins, while the Tejas Mk1A was rejected due to its Israeli radar. As a result, India plans to equip the Meteor missile on the Tejas Mk2, with plans to later equip the Tejas Mk1A with Indian radar. However, the Rafale requires a better secondary Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile that can complement the Meteor, which is why the Astra was selected. Unfortunately, there are likely to be delays in its implementation."

Despite beginning production of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) for the European conglomerate involved in the program in 2035, Dassault Aviation has made this commitment to its existing customers. The FCAS program, which is set to begin production sometime between 2035 and 2040, will replace the French Dassault Rafale in the French Air Force. However, Dassault has planned two significant upgrades to the Rafale program, the F4.1 standard, aimed at enhancing the connectivity of the Rafale through new satellite and intra-flight links, communications servers, and software radios. This upgrade is intended to improve the Rafale’s effectiveness in net-centric combat and pave the way for the FCAS. In December 2018, the development of the F4 standard was initiated. Flight tests of the F4 upgrade were conducted by the DGA from April 2021, with clearance of the full F4 standard expected in 2024, and some functions to be available in an initial standard by 2022. It is projected that all French Rafales currently in service will be upgraded to the Rafale F4.2 standard by 2030. The upcoming Rafale F5 Standard, expected after 2030, will incorporate new cruise and anti-ship missiles from the Franco-British FMAN and FMC programs, and possibly a new anti-radar munition. The F5 version will need to have the capability to penetrate heavily defended anti-aircraft environments and control combat drones, such as the Remote Carrier from the SCAF program, to expand its detection and engagement capabilities. These drones will be specifically designed to carry detectors and effectors, including radar, electro-optical systems, listening systems electronics, missiles, bombs, jamming or electronic warfare systems, among others. The Rafale F5 Standard, set to be introduced in 2030, is expected to remain in production until around 2040 before the production line shifts to the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

The AIP system was developed by the Naval Materials Research Laboratory (NMRL). The integration is scheduled to take place from mid-2024 onwards, during the submarine’s major refit. According to information obtained by idrw, it has been confirmed that the Kalvari submarine will be the first to undergo retrofitting of the AIP system into its existing hull. This process will involve inserting an additional hull section, which will take around two years to complete. The retrofitting will require cutting the rear hull of the submarine and adding the AIP section to it. As a result, the submarine’s length will increase, and further trials will be necessary, along with operational testing of the AIP system. As AIP systems are not modular or plug-and-play, integrating them requires Original Equipment Manufacturers to undertake significant work. In this instance, the Naval Group must study the impact of adding an AIP section into the hull of the submarine, specifically its effect on manoeuvrability, speed-power performance, and weight distribution. After obtaining the Transfer of Technology (ToT) and conducting multiple levels of demonstration to ensure seamless integration, Larsen & Toubro and Thermax will manufacture the Fuel Cell-based Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) systems developed by NMRL.

The United Kingdom has designed an Integrated Electric Propulsion (IEP) system for its Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers and is proposing a collaborative effort with India to develop a localized version of the technology. IEP is a modification of the traditional combined diesel-electric and gas propulsion system used in ships. It replaces mechanical transmission with the electrical transmission, enabling a series hybrid electric propulsion system that eliminates the need for clutches and reduces or eliminates the need for gearboxes. The power electronics components of the IEP system control the flow of electrical energy to the motors. They consist of power converters, inverters, and other electrical devices that regulate the voltage, current, and frequency of the electrical power to the motors. The power electronics components also enable the system to operate in various modes, such as variable speed or regenerative braking. Energy storage devices, such as batteries or supercapacitors, are used to store electrical energy for later use. They allow the IEP system to operate even when the power source is not available, and they can also provide additional power during high-demand periods. The control system of the IEP system manages the operation of electric motors, power electronics, and energy storage devices. It monitors the system’s performance and adjusts the power output to optimize efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve manoeuvrability. Overall, the IEP system works by integrating several components that work together to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy to drive a vehicle or vessel. This system provides several benefits, including improved efficiency, reduced emissions, increased reliability, improved manoeuvrability, and quieter operation."

While IAF is tightlipped about the performance of the 5 aircraft that took part in Exercise Desert Flag, idrw.org has learned that it met all operational flight requirements while flying for the first time outside India and participated in diverse fighter engagements. Tejas Mk1A jets will replace the Mig-21Bis interceptor aircraft, which will be phased out by 2025. Tejas Mk1A jets are designed specifically for a defensive interception against an attacking enemy aircraft. Exercise Cobra Warrior was supposed to be the Tejas fleet’s first outing last year, but it was cancelled due to the Ukraine war, so the IAF sent Mirage-2000s instead of the LCA-Tejas fleet this year. LCA-Tejas will also take part in this year’s Cope India exercise with F-15E and will be a regular feature at all planned air exercises in the country in the future. International exposure for the aircraft’s crew is also being considered, as fleet size will increase gradually as updated Tejas Mk1As are introduced."

Because of its sheer size and massive weight for an entire radar system weighing around 500+kgs, the N011M will be replaced in 2024-25 by an upscaled Uttam AESA Radar that will weigh less than half of its predecessor while providing a significantly increased detection range. IAF so far has been happy with the performance that Uttam Mk 2 which has been developed with 900+TR modules that offer 20-30% more search and track range when compared to Mk I had 700+TR modules and currently has been under testing board two LCA-Tejas Prototypes. Mk 2 which was initially developed for the LCA AF-Mk2 Program might also find its way into later batches of Tejas Mk1A. LRDE claims that Mk 2 has superseded in terms of capabilities when compared to contemporary Radars in its class, it exceeds the performance of the Israeli ELTA ELM-2052 AESA Radar and Mk3 is a further buildup of the Mk2 technology will see a radar antenna that could accommodate 1200-1400+TR modules surpassing 270+km search range and 100+km track range of the present N011M Bars PESA Radar in all modes by a 25-40% that will allow pilots of the upgraded Su-30MKI to see further and engage targets with Astra Mk1 (110km), Mk2(160km) and Mk3 (200km+) for fighter size targets. The IAF intends to send two Su-30MKI aircraft for integration and airborne flight testing, which will likely take another 24 months before the radar is ready for production in 2028-29. LRDE and IAF will most likely incorporate new radar on at least 150 Su-30MKI fleet units over the next 4-5 years after it enters production, most likely on the newer units, while older units may continue to operate with older N011M Bars PESA Radar due to age."

The immediate step after the clearance could be metal cutting to start production of the prototype which will be rolled out four years from the date of the CCS clearance and will be followed by four more prototypes that will join the flight developmental program one year apart from the first flight of the prototype. ADA intends to develop a ground-test specimen that will be used to carry out a slew of tests that aircraft must go through before their first flight, such as flight loads simulation, material static and fatigue testing, structural dynamics, modal analysis, airborne and structure-borne acoustics, landing gear tests, checking electronics for electromagnetic interference, and running the engines to ensure adequate performance. The first two prototypes will be used to carry out checks on the Digital Flight Control Computers (DFCC), Avionics, flight parameters at different altitudes, day-night time flying and other testing parameters of the internal weapons, serpentine air intake etc. The third and fourth prototypes will be used for testing out the weapons capabilities of the aircraft along with certifying them for Initial operational clearance in Air to Air Mode and later also for Air to Surface Mode over the next few years. The last Prototype will be the first pre-production aircraft that will have near production-ready capabilities including all the systems and subsystems that were gradually included from the first to fourth prototype that will be tested also by the User (Airforce) before it is cleared for production in around 2032. IAF plans to procure 40 AMCA MkI Standard aircraft in the first phase and another 100 AMCA MkII Standard aircraft in the second phase that will incorporate Supercruise capabilities thanks to its new 110kN Class high-powered engine but with likely delays in the new jet engine program it is expected that IAF eventually might agree to procure MkI Standard in higher numbers to avoid idling of the production plant."

The delivery of these advanced warships is set to commence in March 2027. These NGMVs are designed to be heavily armed, featuring state-of-the-art stealth technology, remarkable speed, and offensive capabilities. Surface warfare capabilities, advanced stealth features such as low radar cross section (RCS), acoustic, magnetic, and infrared (IR) signatures, and so on will be included in NGMVs. NGMVs will have a range of 5185 kilometers at an economic speed of 10 knots and a range of 1852 kilometers at a maximum speed of 35 knots. NGMVs will be outfitted with eight surface-to-surface missiles (SSM), most likely it will be BrahMos Cruise missiles, as well as a DRDO developed Vertical Launch – Short Range Surface to Air Missile, or VL-SRSAM, which will provide credible near 360-degree anti-missile defence (AMD) coverage to the ship against subsonic cruise missiles to supersonic cruise missiles. NGMVs will be capable of conducting Maritime Strike Operations, Anti Surface Warfare Operations, and will be a powerful tool for sea denial for enemy ships, particularly at choke points. The NGMV will sit right below Kamorta-class corvette which even though has a bigger displacement but are not integrated with BrahMos. If Cochin Shipyard Ltd plays its cards correctly, it may become the next big thing in the export market, as many smaller countries would like to have ships like the NGMV that can be integrated with Cruise missile such has BrahMos that can sink ships that have 3-4 times more displacement. NGMV due to BrahMos allows it to punch above its weight and take on bigger Naval ships that what many smaller Navy’s are eyeing for.

Navy’s MiG 29K fleet to be scrapped post-2035,https://idrw.org/navys-mig-29k-fleet-to-be-scrapped-post-2035/,"April 11, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. Indian Navy inducted MiG-29K supersonic air dominance fighters in 2010 but will get rid of the entire fleet of around 41 jets from service by 2025 onwards with less than 25 years of service in the fleet due to severe built quality issues with the jets that often requires periodic inspections at regular small intervals. MiG-29K came with a 25-year design life of 6,000 hours and with a life extension programme it could have served Indian Navy for another 10-15 years but idrw.org has learned that the Navy has no such plans to enhance the service span for the fleet and instead entire fleet will be scrapped after retirement. According to the 2016 Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, since induction, the fleet’s serviceability ranged from 21.30 per cent to 47.14 per cent, with over 40 engines having to be withdrawn due to design-related defects blamed on the Russian Military Complex’s poor quality. The Indian Navy intends to replace the Mig-29K fleet with 45 Twin Engine Deck Based Fighters (TEDBF) a “5th generation minus” from 2035 onwards, but idrw.org has learned that the Navy is unsure that the fleet will last beyond 2030 due to airframe defects, discrepancies, and anomalies that will make flying dangerous as it ages. To relieve pressure on the Mig-29K fleet, the Indian Navy is interested in acquiring 26 Rafale M fighter jets before 2030, according to media reports. The deal could be announced soon, and the contract could be signed within the next 18 months. Rational behind the Selection of Mig-29K The Mig-29K was chosen due to experience with the Indian Air Force, which has been operating 60-odd Mig-29A (later upgraded to UPG) since the late 1980s, as India was the type’s second launch customer after the Soviet Air Force. Mig-29K is based on the ‘basic’ MiG-29K airframe that was re-engineered to be used as Deck-based fighter aircraft by Soviet Aircraft carriers but the program came to an abrupt halt after the collapse of the Soviet Union and that program was only revived after India was Gifted Admiral Gorshkov allegedly free of cost but still had to pay $2.35 billion for the upgrade and refit of the vessel and an additional US$1 billion for the aircraft and weapons systems. The Indian Navy gave the MiG-29K a new lease on life, and it later found its way onto the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, which was only operating Su-33 Strike aircraft at the time. The Navy still claims it was the best choice available at the time, but many see it as a choice between lesser evils because the Su-33 continues to have a bad reputation in the Russian Navy, which later decided to ditch it in 2009 for the relatively newer Mig-29K."

The Indian Air Force (IAF) is looking to purchase 60-80 Medium Transport Aircraft (MTA) to be used as Medium Haul Transporters, for which it has already solicited bids from international aerospace companies that might agree to jointly manufacture them in the country under Transfer of Technology (ToT). idrw.org has learned that whichever is selected will be used as a platform for the development of flight refuelling aircraft (FRA) and airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) as it plans to have more indigenous platforms to beef up its requirements as Chinese PLAAF expands its fleet of Force Multipliers. The IAF will acquire six next-generation AEW&C Netra MkII Suite mounted on Ex-Air India Airbus A321 aircraft, which will begin induction into the IAF in the next 4-5 years, as the current fleet stands at six (3 IL-78 Phalcon, 3 Netra MkI) against a requirement of nearly 18-24 units on both fronts. The IAF had planned to purchase six 360-degree coverage AWACS based on the Airbus A330 platform, but this is likely to be rejected due to cost, as has been seen in the past. The IAF operates six IL-78-based flight refuelling aircraft (FRA), but due to the fleet’s low availability rate, it is usually reserved for special operations or in the situation of heightened alerts. IAF intends to lease one FRA from France based on the Airbus A330 aircraft from the French Air Force and is looking to convert MTA into Mini FRA aircraft for long-term use in the event of war, while also considering HAL’s proposal to acquire converted six Boeing-767 civilian aircraft into mid-air refuellers for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The IAF intends to have 12-13 full-time FRA and 12-20 Mini-Multi Mission Tanker Transport Aircraft based on the MTA platform. The IAF’s long-term vision for the Force Multiplier is to have enough backup assets to use in the event of war while also building a full-fledged fleet over the next ten years."

"India thinks big on military exports to Africa, Tejas jets, Akash missiles, combat helicopters",https://idrw.org/india-thinks-big-on-military-exports-to-africa-tejas-jets-akash-missiles-combat-helicopters/,"May 3, 2023","SOURCE: IANS India has introduced a holistic approach to push military exports to Africa, combining pitch for weapon sales with finance, training, infra development and soft-power. The new initiative also calls for synergy between India’s development efforts and strategic outreach through Line of Credit (LoC) in 42 African Union countries. India would be assisting in building IT & technical training institutes, schools, health centres, roads, railways and ports, etc., paving the way for supplying Made-in-India armaments. India has already messaged African Union members that its locally built armaments are far superior in quality and durability compared with Chinese armaments and much cheaper than Western defence systems. To endorse India’s development and strategic outreach efforts External Affairs Minister Subramanyam Jaishankar visited Uganda and the Republic of Mozambique from April 10-15. He also made a brief stopover in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on April 13. The visit witnessed the opening of the India-assisted National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) in Jinja, Uganda, the first imitative of its kind in Africa. The EAM also reviewed development projects related to railways, roads and bridge infrastructure projects and a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Mozambique. The high-mobility military vehicles were also gifted to the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces. Peacekeeping has been a vital element of the India-Africa partnership since 1960. Over 6,000 Indians currently serve in peacekeeping operations in African countries. India’s decision to open 18 new diplomatic missions in Africa in the next few years, which will take the total number to 47, reflects its new Afro-centric approach. To enhance defence exports and capacity-building efforts, India hosted top military commanders and service chiefs from 31 member countries of the African Union to participate in the first India-Africa Army Chiefs’ Conclave on 28 March in Pune. The Ministry of Defence said: “The Conclave focussed on joint training and defence cooperation amongst the nations to evolve an institutionalised framework to enhance collaboration in the fields of joint military training, execution of peacekeeping operations; besides promoting Indian defence industries.” Additionally, the 2nd Africa-India Joint Exercise ‘AFINDEX’ was also held at Foreign Training Node, Aundh in Pune from March 16 to 29, 2023 with 124 participants from 25 African countries including Ethiopia, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Africa. On the sidelines of the exercise an ‘Equipment Display’ was organised in which 75 indigenous defence products from 32 domestic companies were showcased. Currently, several African Union member countries regularly buy ‘Made in India’ armaments. The main buyers are Botswana, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, Somalia, and South Africa. In some cases, India has even gifted armaments and military equipment to Mauritius and Seychelles. Several defence public undertakings regularly export defence equipment to Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, Kenya, Libya, Malawi, Mauritius, Myanmar, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Surinam, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The government has also nominated a few Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) as export promotion agencies for selected African Union member countries to promote defence exports. “Subject to strategic considerations, domestically manufactured defence products will be promoted through Government-to-Government agreements and Lines of Credit/Funding,” MoD adds. India is offering its key home-built weapons and platforms including Tejas fighters, light combat & utility helicopters, Akash missile batteries, artillery guns, Pinaka rockets launchers, besides, armoured vehicles, mobility vehicles, drones, loitering munitions, small arms, offshore patrol vessels, interceptor crafts, communication and surveillance equipment, etc for export to key African Union member allies. India has set an armaments exports target of $5 billion by 2025 to achieve self-reliance in developing and building weapons & platforms. While India achieved $1.75 billion in defence exports in 2022 and is targeting $2.37 billion in 2023. The majority of armament exports will be executed by private defence companies. One of the key MEA policy initiatives is to engage India Exim Bank to extend soft Lines of Credit (LoC) to Mauritius, Mozambique and Seychelles for the export of India-built weapons & platforms. The Exim Bank branches spread across Africa are exploring facilitating need-based LoC for the export of aerospace, defence, and maritime equipment with other African countries as well. India plans to export armaments and provide medical training to the armies of Botswana, Egypt, Kenya, Lesotho, Morocco, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Interestingly, Nigeria will be the first country to buy unspecified numbers of indigenously built Light Combat Helicopters from state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd through soft credit. Six officers from the Nigerian Army have already completed training on Chetak and Dhruv light helicopters at HAL’s Rotary Wing Academy in Bangalore. Besides promoting defence exports, India is also focusing on capability building in agriculture and agro-processing, health and pharmaceuticals and disaster management and disaster management. Indian private companies mainly work in Africa under the Indian LoC projects through the Exim Bank of India. However, very few private companies want to invest their own money in Africa and instead, they want to pursue projects through grants only. For Indian private companies, Africa has not fully emerged as a favourable destination. (Vivek Raghuvanshi specialises in Indian and global military industry.

AMCA Mk2 program will revolve around a new engine that can have an “Adaptive cycle” engine, that is designed for maximum efficiency across subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight speeds. The engine should offer Supercruise capability without engaging afterburners at 1.4 Mach and has Thermal Management (TM) to remove excessive heat without affecting its thermal signature and not reduce its efficiency in Hot-Humid Indian conditions which GE offers lacks. idrw.org has been told that using baseline F414-INS6 engines might cut costs for both but won’t be capable of providing the additional power and cooling needed to support further aircraft improvements or maintain the stealthiness of the aircraft. It’s of opinion in the engine study group in India to have a more sensible approach that is to develop a new engine that has a built-in growth margin and is modular in design so that the fighter jet can evolve to keep up with emerging threats without requiring expensive Engine Core Upgrade (ECU). The new engine needs to be fuel-efficient and powerful while still having the ability to mask its thermal signature so that it can be used in future variants of AMCA or even in the Next-Gen fighter program that might go active in 2040 n beyond."

OPINION : Hitting two birds with one aircraft,https://idrw.org/opinion-hitting-two-birds-with-one-aircraft/,"March 21, 2023","SOURCE: DINESH BEHARA/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Gripen is a multi-role fighter aircraft by Sweden-based Saab AB Company. It is in service with countries such as Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa, Thailand, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. Gripen can fill the requirement of two contemporary acquisition programs for IAF, thereby reducing the duration for acquisition and increasing the squadrons of fighter aircraft. 1. Gripen can replace the need for Tejas Mk2 In the first instance, one might think how crazy will it be to substitute an indigenous aircraft with an imported one when riding high on the theme of self-reliance. Strategically, importing defence needs is discouraged but as per the latest SIPRI reports, even though there has been a considerable decrease, India still is the largest importer at 11% of global imports[1]. There are even some more acquisitions in the pipeline such as Aerial Refueling aircraft, Medium Transport Aircraft, AWE&Cs, Carrier-based fighter aircraft for INS Vikrant, etc. which all are going to be imported. Then, why not import an aircraft which can fulfill the requirements that we are exactly developing in Tejas Mk2 which is akin to Gripen? Tejas Mk2 is a further development of HAL Tejas. In terms of design, both aircraft have delta plus canard wings and a single vertical stabilizer configuration, powered by a single GE F414 powerplant. From the above comparison, one easily spot the similarities. Gripen E is marginally better in terms of performance and with 10 hardpoints against 13, it carries more payload than Tejas Mk2. As for weaponry both are on par and share Meteor missiles in common, which are used in Rafales also other indigenous or French weapons can be adapted such as MICA, SCALP, Astra, Spice, etc. Tejas Mk2 is currently in its early developmental stages with the prototype planned to roll out by the end of 2023[4], and serial production by 2028[5]. Hence, considering any unfortunate delays in the Tejas Mk2 program and the current squadron strength of IAF, Gripen E would be a good bet. 2. Gripen can fill the MRFA requirement. Once touted as the ‘mother of all defence deals’ MMRCA (Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft) tender in 2007 was intended to acquire 126 fighter aircraft[6], then in 2018 comes MRFA (Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft) or MMRCA 2.0 tender for 114 aircraft[7], as 36 Rafales were acquired, which was finalized in 2015[8].This requirement which is continuing for the last 15 years needs to be closed. Again, Gripen is one of the contenders among the likes of Boeing F-18, Boeing F-15, LM F-21, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Sukhoi Su-35, and MiG-35. Dassault Rafale is the favourite and previously IAF had selected Rafale as the winner in the MMRCA tender. But there are disagreements over the share of technology to Manufacture locally in India by HAL. Gripen’s unit cost of $85M is less than Rafale’s $115M[9]. Saab has agreed to the full technology transfer of Gripen to India[10]. The current amalgamation of Gripen includes 67% of components sourced from European suppliers and 33% from the U.S.[11] Gripen shares a lot of technology with French systems, and India has a lot of French-origin weapons and avionics hence, the aircraft can be easily adapted. Also, customization with indigenous radar, missiles, avionics is possible. Conclusion The requirement for MRFA is 114 and Tejas Mk2 is around 120, which makes about 13 to 14 squadrons. The GE F414-INS6 engine is also common between Gripen E and AMCA (until upgraded by an engine produced with joint-venture with full ToT or IP rights). Therefore, Gripen is best positioned to be elected for IAF. One it will clear the conundrum of MMRCA or MRFA tenders with a lesser acquisition cost. Two, with similar features, specifications, and performance it can replace the Tejas Mk2, and by doing so, we can fully shift the focus for AMCA, which will be a vital leap in generational technology propelling towards 5th gen aircraft.

AUKUS: India’s silent backing might help its nuclear submarine programs,https://idrw.org/aukus-indias-silent-backing-might-help-its-nuclear-submarine-programs/,"March 21, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG AUKUS partnership with Australia, the UK and the US for the supply of nuclear-powered submarines and local manufacturing of a new class of nuclear-powered submarines might benefit India in the long term since it has remained silent on this deal but India’s support helped block Beijing and Moscow plans to prohibit the transfer of nuclear technology to Australia. India which is working to develop three new attack submarine programs will be beneficiary of its silent support to the AUKUS partnership as it will be getting some of the niche technology for its program that will help expedite its program. While India getting access to nuclear reactor technology is highly unlikely but it will see support and access to other dual-usage technology clearance from the western countries in terms of sensors, navigation and other communication systems. France is keen to offer its non-nuclear technology to India’s nuclear attack submarine program might fast-track its pace in the development of niche next-generation pump-jet propulsion without much trouble from Western countries. India will seek possible cooperation in lower acoustic signature management via new-age materials and a well-designed pump jet that is considerably quieter than an equivalent propeller, support for improving its hydrodynamics and hydroacoustics program as well as experimental facilities."
Private firm to make Ceramic Radome for missiles and jets in India,https://idrw.org/private-firm-to-make-ceramic-radome-for-missiles-and-jets-in-india/,"March 21, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Research Centre Imarat (RCI), one of the premier DRDO labs has signed a “Licensing Agreement for Tran­sfer of Technology” with a Chennai-based Private sector company Carborundum Universal Limited (CUMI) for manufacturing ceramic radomes used in aerospace and missile systems. In a press statement, CUMI said that Ceramic radome technology is widely regarded as cutting-edge missile technology around the world. Because missiles experience extremely high surface temperatures while travelling through the atmosphere, ceramic is thought to be an ideal radome material. To ensure reliability and accuracy, the design of ceramic radomes for defence activities necessitates deep expertise and stringent testing at every stage. CUMI claims that its lightweight ceramic ballistic solutions, made of Alumina, Zirconia-Toughened Alumina, and Silicon Carbide, are ergonomic and customizable for use in bulletproof vests. According to the company, CUMI’s lightweight ceramic materials provide the highest levels of ballistic and blast-proof protection for armoured vehicles."
OPINION : Why India should consider ordering more Russian Frigates,https://idrw.org/opinion-why-india-should-consider-ordering-more-russian-frigates/,"March 21, 2023","SOURCE: JOYDEEP GHOSH / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Logic says India must buy Admiral Kornilov FFG, it is an Admiral Grigorovich-class FFG, also referred to as Krivak V class frigate built by the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad. 6 Krivak V or Admiral Grigorovich-class FFG were to be built for the Russian Navy at Yantar Shipyard to keep the shipyard busy from 2010 onwards so as to complement the Admiral Gorshkov class FFGs that were designed and construction started 2006 onward at Severnaya Verf shipyard. These 6 Krivak V FFGs were based on the 6 Talwar class FFGs that Indian Navy ordered for itself and heavily customized them as per its own requirements in late 1990s. These ships were built in Russian shipyards of Baltiysky Zavod and Yantar at 3 each from early 2000s, and their engines were supplied by Ukraine. Impressed by the features of Talwar class FFGs that pack lot of punch for their size, Russian Navy decided to order the same FFGs in same configuration and named them Admiral Grigorovich-class FFG. These 6 ships were ordered for the Russian Black Sea Fleet under two contracts in 2010 and 2011, and just like 6 Talwar class FFGs, Russian Navy too ordered engines for these ships from Ukraine. Everything was going fine and the lead ship of Krivak V / Admiral Grigorovich FFGs was launched with Ukrainian engine in March 2014, but then Russia claimed Crimea and moved in to annex it. Enraged Ukraine which had already supplied engines for Admiral Essen and Admiral Makarov, now decided to stop the supply of engines for the remaining 3half-builtAdmiral Grigorovich FFGs, namely Admiral Butakov, Admiral Istomin andAdmiral Kornilov. So, while Grigorovich, Essen and Makarov were in advanced stages of construction; construction of Butakov, Istomin and Kornilov was suspended in 2016. While Butakov, Istomin were in various stages of construction, Kornilov was last to be laid down just before Russia had annexed Crimea either in late 2013 or early 2014. Initially it was decided that India will buy the engines from Ukraine and then ship them to Russia. At first there was delay in tripartite talks, then Ukraine said it will sell the engines only if India bought the ships. Initially Russian Navy opposed the sale of 2 unfinished Grigorovich FFGs to India and set out to develop its own engines, but faced many challenges. Though R&D work on alternative engines continued and most probably the engines developed as such are being used in the Admiral Goshkov class FFGs. However, due to delay in sourcing the engines a vexed Russia decided to sell the Butakov renamed Tushil, and Istomin renamed Tamala to India in 2018 and work on them was restarted in late 2021 as India decided to fund their construction, however Kornilov FFG that was still in early stages of construction was untouched. Logic says India should buy Kornilov too and fund its construction, as now Russia looks not interested in inducting that ship. Reports say Russia is planning to sell this single ship to a 3rdcountry. If so then it will be huge mistake by that country as its impossible to maintain a single huge ship like Kornilov. Its maintenance will be much easier for India as India Navy already has 8 of them. India and Russia must come together to decide its sale or Kornilov FFG will meet the same fate as Slava class Cruiser ‘Ukraina’ that is now a rusting hulk. 1 More Talwar FFG from GSL When Russia decided to sell Butakov renamed Tushil, and Istomin renamed Tamala to India in 2018; India insisted on full ToT so that Goa Shipyard Ltd or GSL can build 2 more of these Talwar class or Grigorovich FFGs in India, thus allowing another shipyard to gain capability to build principal surface combatants besides GRSE and MDL. The 1st named INS Triput and 2nd yet unnamed are well under construction that started in 2021. Now GSL has invested lot of money on setting up infrastructure and HR. As shown above shipyards have built ships in set of 3 as that helps amortize the investment made in infrastructure setup and HR. Logic says building just 2 ships won’t help GSL amortize the investment it has done in the project as such it is important that 1 more Talwar FFG is ordered from GSL. Do remember it is this same reason that MDL had been requesting for order of 3 additional Scorpène submarine. Thankfully better sense has prevailed and these will be ordered soon. Many will say what is the point in ordering 2 more of these ships when we have had enough with 10 of these. For them an analogy from boxing; here heavyweight boxers are destroyers and middleweight boxers are frigates. The heavyweight boxers though small in numbers are huge, make more money and name, but its’ the middleweight boxers who number more and are considered more efficient than heavyweight boxers in pound for pound fighting. So, in that context, more the number of efficient frigates we have the better. As such it is important that 1 more Talwar FFG is ordered from GSL. I hope better sense prevails and this will be ordered soon.

Malaysia picked FA-50 over LCA-Tejas due to ‘Service Record’: Report,https://idrw.org/malaysia-picked-fa-50-over-lca-tejas-due-to-service-record-report/,"March 20, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) last month got the contract to supply 18 FA-50 Golden Eagle Trainer/Combat aircraft from the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) where India’s very own LCA-Tejas Mk1A jet was a distant second in the race during the final selection process as per latest Malaysian media reports. Malaysian then-defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein praised the FA-50 Golden Eagle last year as a ‘reliable platform based on good reputation’, it was probably was first signs why it was picked. This Week Present Defense Minister Mohamad Hasan said in parliament that the FA-50 decision was based on the platform’s ‘service record’, adding that Malaysia does not want its military personnel to be involved in a ‘laboratory test’. FA-50 and JF-17 both had higher production rates and units has export success which might have gone against India’s LCA-Tejas. India has inducted only 40 odd Tejas Mk1 fighter jets, but IAF has placed further orders for 83 more jets with 50 more additional units to be procured in the pipeline, but it seems it was not impressive for the Malaysian Military Planners since KAI has manufactured nearly 200 units of T-50/FA-50 variants in last 15 years and the jet is flown by Air forces of the Indonesia, Iraq, Philippines, Poland, Thailand and host country South Korea. Malaysia did acknowledge that Tejas could have been a much cheaper option than FA-50 and was much more capable but RMAF faced several issues with its now retired Russian-supplied Mig-29 and continues to face service and spare issues with its Su-30MKM fleet and clearly, they didn’t want to bet on LCA-Tejas due to several delays first in induction of this jets in IAF and low rate of production . Tejas fleet in IAF will expand and the rate of production will pick up in the next few years as IAF is set to induct the first batch of upgraded Tejas Mk1A fighter jets from 2024 onwards."

Prime Minister Modi will be remembered for having brought “justice to refugees from Pakistan settled in Jammu and Kashmir and to the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir who were deprived of their constitutional rights of citizenship and owning property”, the minister of state for personnel said referring to the government’s 2019 decision. He said as a result of the corrective measures adopted by Prime Minister Modi, India’s stature has risen globally, and there is no ambiguity left as far as India’s position about Jammu and Kashmir is concerned which is, it is an integral part of the Indian Union. “If only the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had allowed the then home minister Sardar Patel to handle Jammu and Kashmir in the same manner he was handling other princely states of India, today the part of Jammu and Kashmir that is illegally occupied by Pakistan would have been a part of India and the issue of PoK would have never have risen,” the minister said, according to an official statement. “However, he said, it is very much on the agenda of the government led by Prime Minister Modi and the BJP as a political party to retrieve the illegally occupied PoK from the control of Pakistan and restore it back to India,” it said. Different groups that interacted with Singh told him about the recent activities conducted by them to unite groups of people of Indian origin against anti-India forces, the statement said. The minister told them that time has come to create “our own narrative so that false narratives created by our adversaries do not gain upper hand”. Under Prime Minister Modi, the world is ready to listen to India’s viewpoint and the message that nobody can challenge or harm the integrity and sovereignty of India should go loud and clear across all sections, he said. The meeting, which lasted for nearly an hour, consisted of people engaged in different areas of work and hailing from different regions of Jammu and Kashmir. Present in the meeting were also representatives of the Jammu and Kashmir Study Centre branch in London who have their main office in New Delhi. There were also members of Dogra organisations of Jammu and Kashmir and members of Kashmiri Pandit activist groups, the statement said. Singh appreciated the manner in which they had contributed in correcting the negative narrative about India, particularly in the context of Jammu and Kashmir, by certain “vested interests” and had also stood up to the challenge of anti-India forces in the UK, the statement added."

"OPINION : With Australia receiving Virginia-class submarines, Hope India may be spared of Western hypocrisy",https://idrw.org/opinion-with-australia-receiving-virginia-class-submarines-hope-india-may-be-spared-of-western-hypocrisy/,"March 13, 2023","SOURCE: DEEPAK HILORI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG In the first phase, Australia will purchase three to five Virginia-class nuclear submarines from the United States, and in the second phase, it will purchase a second line of AUKUS-class submarines based on UK designs and US technology, to be built beginning in the mid-to-late 2030s, with at least some of the construction taking place at the Osborne shipyards in Adelaide. The United Kingdom and the United States will not only sell Virginia-class nuclear submarines to Australia, but will also supply key nuclear technology, such as nuclear reactors, to Australia for local production of the submarines. In 2019, India signed a $3 billion contract with Russia for the lease of an Akula-1 class submarine, dubbed the Chakra III nuclear submarine, which will arrive in India by 2025 with induction in 2026. With the ongoing war and the fallout from Russian economic sanctions, it is unclear whether India has been able to make payments for the submarine and the progress of Russia’s refurbishment work. However, with China’s growing naval presence and delays in its own nuclear submarine project, India has planned to acquire a second SSN, allowing the navy to operate two independent carrier battle groups, each with one SSN, centered on the INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant. India, which has a critical role to play in the Indo-Pacific to counter Chinese activities in the region, has remained silent on the AUKUS development, and since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it has been less vocal about the deal in order to avoid drawing too much attention to its own deal with Russia. India is leasing Akula Class submarines from Russia to advance its own Nuclear attack submarine programme, but Western hypocrisy knows no bounds, and this could be interpreted as India’s efforts to fund the war in Western media while they rush to sell nuclear submarines to a country that is less likely to go to war with China than India and has no history of conflicts with China. The Indian PMO, with the assistance of NSA Ajit Doval, has been able to keep the Indian Nuclear submarine programme out of the spotlight. However, leasing of Russian Akula class submarines and another two that are in the pipeline will play a critical role in the development of the local nuclear attack submarine programme as well as the larger ballistic missile submarine that are all set to go on the market.

IAF is looking to procure nearly 80 medium-lift military transport aircraft that will replace 118 An-32 Short-haul Transporter and seems to have dropped plans to procure more C-295 that are classified in the same class of aircraft but instead, it has decided to go for a plane with nearly double the cargo carrying capacity then An-32 it intends to replace. IAF in long term is looking to procure nearly 80-100 medium-lift military transport aircraft and another 30-40 Heavy-lift military transport aircraft that eventually will be needed as the oldest of the IL-76 Heavy-lift military transport aircraft has turned 40 and still suffers from a low availability rate that will shorten their operational life further due to prolonged grounding of the aircraft. Massive requirements for MTA and HTA do provide the Indian Aviation sector with a Golden opportunity to liberate India’s Strategic airlift capability and its dependence on foreign-manufactured aircraft if both programs are combined and co-developed with the reputed aerospace manufacturer to kill two birds with one stone. IAF needs a plane that can fit in between C-130J and C-17 with a payload carrying capacity of nearly 30 tons and another that will initially replace the IL-76 fleet and supplement the C-17 fleet that has become globetrotter for the IAF in its mission abroad. MTA and HTA can be based on the same principal baseline design as C1 and C2 done by Kawasaki in Japan and can be used to further develop a 60-ton payload-carrying aircraft that are both indigenous and meets the requirements also of it domestic aviation market. Countries with lesser aircraft requirements like Japan have developed their Strategic airlift capability while reducing reliance on imported airlift capability which is often the backbone of all wars and its high time that India decides to take up such projects so that for the next 70 years it has an independent airlift capability."

Resulting in magnetic field fluctuations recorded on ground-based magnetometers”. In Ukraine when Russia fired its Kh-22, a long-range anti-ship missile that was developed in the late 60s and similar hypersonic spikes were detected on the magnetometers since the missile is perfectly capable of going above 4.5 Mach. BrahMos is a supersonic cruise missile that can hit Mach 3 and efforts are being made to increase its supersonic speeds to near hypersonic cruise regime that starts from Mach 5 onwards but BrahMos-ER or X at best will top out at near 4 to 4.5 Mach in near future or it already has been done. Experts agree that missile that often go near Hypersonic speeds can trigger Hypersonic spikes in the acoustic waves that it produces but that’s not often the case. BrahMos-2K which will be based on the Russian 3M22 Zircon will see the development of true Hypersonic class cruise missiles. Cordaro later agreed that he should have been little more careful with his wording as he too agreed that Brahmos went supersonic and not Hypersonic"

Even though India never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after came next were economic sanctions on India for its series of underground nuclear tests by none other than the United States which lead to suppliers cancelling their agreements and European firms stopping cooperation which was a major setback for country’s LCA-Tejas program. India has acquired 8 F404-F2J3 engines from GE Aviation to power initial batches of LCA-Tejas prototypes and 98 sanctions meant engine spares and other supplies had halted and by the time the first flight of TD-1 of LCA-Tejas was carried out in 2001, but it meant that India had to cannibalize perfectly working engines to be used as spares so that already delayed program doesn’t suffer more delays. For nearly a year LCA-Tejas TD-1 flew very few conservative sorties due to ongoing sanctions and things only improved when in December 2001 sanctions were officially lifted by the United States and the supply of spares resumed in 2002 onwards. In 2004, India placed orders for 17 F404-GE-IN20 engines to power a limited series of operational production aircraft and naval prototypes that was followed up with additional orders of 24 F404-GE-IN20 after burning engines in 2007. In 2021 HAL placed further orders for 99 F404-GE-IN20 engines for Tejas Mk1A light combat aircraft. India till now has placed orders for 159 F404-GE-IN20 engines with 60 delivered but with no localisation nor even setting up of local Maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) facilities in the country are still a work in progress. Sanction-proofing jet engine technology is a complex issue that involves various aspects such as legal, technical, and strategic considerations. Here are some suggestions on how to make jet engine technology sanction-proof: Overall, making jet engine technology sanction-proof requires a comprehensive approach that involves legal compliance, domestic capabilities, diversifying suppliers, protecting intellectual property, technology transfer restrictions, strategic partnerships, and continual development.

Talks with French multinational company Safran and GTRE that have gone on for nearly 7 years have not resulted in any agreement and new offers from the American General Electric and British Rolls Royce are competing hard to dethrone advances made by Safran in talks with India. Rolls Royce is offering intellectual property (IP) Rights of the new engine to India and also exempted any permission required from them for the export of the engine thus allowing India free hand to sell the engine or the fighter jets to countries who are interested in them. Rolls Royce initially had offered an upscaled variant of the EJ-200 but now has offered to develop a new engine from scratch so that the engine has growth potential to develop upto 130kN Class of thrust to be used on fighter jets that will come after AMCA. General Electric is offering an advanced variant of its F-414 engine for the AMCA Mk2 while the F-414 engine generating 98N class of thrust will power AMCA Mk1 along with the Tejas Mk2, HLFT-42 and TEDBF fighter jets. GE is claiming to offer 100% of the ToT for its F-414 derivate engines for the AMCA program but it is not clear if it will allow India to own intellectual property (IP) Rights of the key core engine section. idrw.org was told that the engine swap that was planned on the AMCA Mk1 along with the Tejas Mk2 and TEDBF fighter jets from F-414 to the new 110kN class of engine as part of the MLU will be much smoother if the new engine is also from the General Electric or it might require some changes to the air intakes and lower fuselage sections to accommodate engine with different dimensions. Safran is in a tight spot since its M88 engine core can support upscaling of up to 105kN to 110kN by increasing the bypass rate, and cold core augmentation but now GTRE wants a 110Kn Class of engine that can be upscaled to 120 or 130kN of thrust to make it future proof so that it can also be used for fighter jets or Transport aircraft as a turbofan engine variant for other projects. Safran will need to abandon its plans to use M88 Core and come up with a new engine core that has such growth prospects but India will need to pump in nearly 15000-18000 crores only into this engine program if it wants intellectual property (IP) Rights and no export hindrance but the price is too steep for India."

Usually, when anti-radiation missiles are fired from the aircraft this forces air defence systems to go offline before already-airborne missiles detect the radar waves emitting from the main radar systems and change course to engage them. Going offline also means a free hand to the enemy aircraft to carry out operations but keeping air defence systems online with an Anti-radiation decoy system nearby will make it quite difficult for enemy fighter jets to breach air defence."

Indian has shown no interest in foreign-made 5th generation fighter jets such as the Su-57 and F-35, with the Indian Air Force Chief firmly supporting the development of India’s own AMCA 5th generation fighter jets over imports. Russia is looking to offer its Su-75 checkmate to the export market, but without any significant investment from the company or interest from its own airforce. Su-75 checkmate is already facing delays due to Western sanctions on Russian state-owned enterprises, and many Middle Eastern countries that were denied access to 5th generation fighters such as the F-35 are now less interested in the programme. South Korean and Turkish fifth-generation fighter programmes are receiving much-needed attention from countries that cannot afford the F-35 and are not interested in the Chinese J-31. The Su-75 programme requires financial support from export countries in order to be a viable 5th generation offering, but it has none, and India will be the least interested in the programme."

Under the NGERA program, DRDO will develop ERA capable of defeating anti-tank missiles equipped with tandem-shaped charge warheads in addition to mono-shaped charges and kinetic energy projectiles. NGERA technology is based on a newly developed less sensitive explosive composition, which contains two types of explosives along with other ingredients. The composition and thickness of an explosive sheetwere finalized based on a large number of optimization experiments. NGERA comprises modules of reactive elements housed in metallic panels, which are either welded or bolted on the surface of the tank. The internal shock attenuator in the reactive elements prevents sympathetic detonation of adjacent modules inside the panels. The explosive being insensitive as compared to that used in previous versions of ERA, it is safer in handling, storage and operation. NGERA has been developed in association with DMRL and CVRDE as per the protection requirements of NGMBT and it can be adaptable to any tank as per the requirement. NGERA has been evaluated against two types of in-service tandem-shaped charge warheads and tank-fired 125mm FSAPDS ammunition. NGERA has consistently been able to reduce the penetration of tandem-shaped charge warheads by more than 50 per cent and kinetic energy projectiles by more than 30 per cent. Further, a mockup fitment of NGERA on the T-72 tank was carried out at CVRDE to finalise the fitment aspects. The salient features of NGERA are:•Capable of protection against tandem-shapedcharge warheads and KE projectiles.• Reduction in penetration• Tandem-shaped charge warheads: >50 %• KE projectiles (FSAPDS) :>30 %• New low-sensitivity explosive with a long shelf life(>15 years)• Immune to detonation against small armsammunition• No sympathetic detonation of adjacent modules ofreactive elements• Common size of reactive element for all the panelson tank imparting flexibility for fitment.• Additional weight on the tank: ~1.65 T"

The MK-2 is designed to have improved avionics, weapons, and aerodynamics compared to the earlier version, the Tejas MK-1. It is also planned to have more advanced engines and enhanced air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities. The Indian Air Force has placed an order for 83 Tejas MK-2 aircrafts to replace its aging fighter fleet. Unlike previous plans to have a re-engine F414 variant in a slightly stretched Tejas Mk1 airframe, the LCA AF-Mk2 programme was not what it is today until November 2016, when IAF Air HQ sought aircraft to replace the Mirage-2000 and Mig-29 and asked Aeronautical Development Agency to work on it. In 2018, the IAF requested more changes to the LCA AF-Mk2 programme and requested that ADA incorporate more heavy stand-off weapons. PSQRs (Preliminary Staff Qualitative Requirements) for the LCA AF-Mk2 programme were only released in July 2019. The first milestone was achieved in late 2020 with the successful completion of the preliminary design review (PDR), and the second milestone was achieved in December 2021 with the Deputy Chief of Air Staff (DCAS) accepting its comprehensive design review (CDR), which cleared the way for the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to begin releasing drawings for fabricating the first prototype of LCA AF-Mk2. LCA AF-Mk2, which was supposed to fly 36 months after CCS clearance, will be rolled out by October 31, 2025, with its first flight scheduled for December 20, 2026.

RD-33 Series-3 Engine blades of Mig-29UPG seem to be the brightest due to rectangular intakes fitted to either side of the forward fuselage that provide little deflection of the heat signature of its engines or any cover to its blades from Radar or IRST system. Jaguar fighter jets have a smaller set of engines with smaller rectangular air intakes on either side of the fuselage behind the cockpit do seem to provide a better level of deflection of the heat signature of its engines from the IRST systems but it was expected since Twin Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour engine of Jaguars have less then combine the power of single RD-33 engine. Su-30MKI have rectangular intakes and being bigger than Mig-29 it shows a better heat signature of its AL-31F engines but the aircraft still has huge RCS and the Thermal signature of the aircraft with those AL-31F engines will be easy to be picked up by any aircraft with IRST system at long range. Rafale which features a semi-ventral pitot air intake along with its S-duct (or serpentine inlet) conceals jet engine blades from radar waves, and serrated patterns reduce frontal RCS to a limit as seen in the IR capture of the jet. Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) and infrared signature so it was not a surprise that it showed better Infrared Principles and Signatures than other jets."

OPINION : Airbus / Boeing won’t open final assembly unless there is a local competition,https://idrw.org/opinion-airbus-boeing-wont-open-final-assembly-unless-there-is-a-local-competition/,"January 21, 2023","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Modi government is trying to nudge Global Airline manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing to set up local final assembly lines for some of the popular narrow-body aircraft considering that both have predicted sales of over 2000 aircraft to India in the next 20 years. The Indian commercial aviation industry has made significant strides in recent years, but with the development of indigenous aircraft, it remained a cash cow for Airbus and Boeing which simply is just interested in selling aircraft and throwing crumbles in name of localization of components for their global supply chain that contribute minuscule to the Indian economy. One of the areas that India is lacking is why Global Players like Boeing and Airbus will never want to move any of their final assembly lines to India because, unlike China, India doesn’t have any other option but to buy from them. India’s efforts to develop local small-haul or medium-haul passenger aircraft have been miserable and One of the most notable examples was a lack of trust in the Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) program that was proposed by the CSIR-NAL along with other Indian aerospace companies like Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Indian companies lack experience and foreign companies have no obligation to set up final assembly plans in India due to the lack of any local competition in the market so it’s a win-win situation for them and India will end up burning nearly $200 billion in the next 20 years procuring this jets largely fuelled by Indian Private Airline sector companies that are expanding their fleet. India needs to get its basic right and cant depend on Sarkari Aerospace companies that have no experience nor any manpower resources to work on commercial planes of such a magnitude. But there are several steps that India can take to develop its commercial passenger planes: Overall, developing a commercial passenger plane requires a combination of investment in R&D, building a skilled workforce, collaboration and partnerships, government support, developing infrastructure, focusing on the domestic market and having a long-term vision. With these steps, India can successfully develop its commercial passenger planes and become a major player in the global aerospace industry.

OPINION : Why India remains a novice in the UAVs Space,https://idrw.org/opinion-why-india-remains-a-novice-in-the-uavs-space/,"January 20, 2023","SOURCE: RAJESH AHUJA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG In the 1990s, Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) was tasked to develop Nishant, a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) roles on its borders with Pakistan and China. India was the first among its peers to have its own indigenous RPA/UAV program but fast forward to 2023, and India is still not where it wanted to be while even smaller countries have made rapid progress in the area. Indian first RPA Nishant had it is the first flight in 1995 and was considered a great advancement at that time but technical issues and other changing UAV technology meant that ADE was not able to adapt fast to the changes nor was able to develop a product that met all user requirements. While Trials after Trials continued, Nishant RPA which was ordered in limited units of just four by the Indian Army were all gone by 2015 in crashes. Nishant RPA program lasted for nearly 20 years without any results. while DRDO blamed the lobby in the Indian Army that backed acquiring imported (Israeli) UAVs, Army blamed the lack of mature products that had cleared all technical issues but the program died a slow death and India’s UAV dreams indeed had crash landed. ADE by this time was already working on developing Rustom-I UAV, which was to be used as a template for the bigger Rustom-II medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) UAV that completed its first flight in 2009. Rustom-I was not to be mass-produced as it had only one task to act as a technological demonstrator to mature much of the technology before Rustom-II can take off. Rustom-II carried out its first flight in 2016 and after 7 years it has still not met the final benchmark that was required to touch an altitude of 30,000 ft and endurance of 24 hours. According to media reports, Rustom-II which has been renamed as TAPAS BH-201 still suffers from the overweight penalty that could require a switch to a more powerful engine that is still under development. ADE plans to windup both Archer, An armed variant based on the Rustom-I UAV and Rustom-II aka TAPAS BH-201 by end of this year but the progress of both the programs has been too slow and still not reached user trials rounds which as seen in Nishant RPA program can last for several more years if not for a decade if technical and performance issues persist. India needs to diversify its MALE and HALE UAV Programs and allow the Transfer of technology (ToT) of Rustom-I UAV and Rustom-II to private sector companies and let them come up with indigenous options. Private sector companies have done wonders after it was allowed to work on drones and loitering ammunition.

Kalyani Rafael Advanced Systems (KRAS), under a collaboration between Rafael and India’s Kalyani, assembles kits for the Indo-Israeli Medium Range Surface-to-Air Missile (MRSAM). idrw.org has been told that while Israeli clearance might not be required for the export of the MR-SAM but India still needs to consider taking IAI into confidence if Armenia is still keen on acquiring the MR-SAM system or if it is willing to settle for other Indian-made Air Defence System like Akash-NG. The DRDO in India is also developing its own Barak-8ER called ERSAM, which will use the same airframe but have indigenous content in the missile system with range upto 150km. About MRSAM The MRSAM is an advanced network-centric combat air defence system developed jointly by DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in partnership with the Indian industry comprising private and public sectors, including micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Each MRSAM weapon system comprises one command and control system, one tracking radar, missiles, mobile launcher systems, a combat management system, a mobile power system, a radar power system, and a field service vehicle and It can engage multiple targets at ranges of up to 70km in complex environments."

It’s not clear at this point if Indian Navy will approve the French offer of procuring three more Kalvari Enhanced Class submarines with DRDO developed Air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems and Lithium-ion batteries with a higher percentage of indigenous content. The second proposal that Warship Design Bureau (WDB) had proposed was the development of the Super Kalvari Submarine Program, where the submarine will have two additional modules one for the Air-independent propulsion (AIP) system and the second module for the Vertical launching system (VLS). The submarine proposed under the Super Kalvari Submarine Program could have made the submarine have an estimated overall length of 100m+ with a submerged displacement of over 3000 tons which will be near twice that of the presently submerged displacement of the Kalvari class submarine. If indeed Project-75I -(India) is scrapped then it is likely that India will develop Super Kalvari Submarine Program into a full-fledged program for six submarines and will acquire the required expertise before it commences work on the fully indigenous submarine program for 12 conventional-diesel submarine program after completion of this program."

NASM-MR, with the addition of a solid-fuel rocket booster, will be able to hit targets up to 350 km far, will be Canisterised, and will be designed for attacking small- to medium-sized warships such as frigates, corvettes, and destroyers. The third variant will be the NASM-MR, which will include a solid-fuel rocket booster housed inside a watertight launched capsule that can be fired from the submarine’s torpedo tubes. However, the range of the submarine-launched anti-ship missile may be 100 kilometres less than that of the ship-based variant. NASM-MR based Coastal defence batteries for the Indian Navy are also available, but it may take longer than the other three variants due to Indian Navy requirements.

Engine development from scratch needs to be divided into multiple phases and work share in each phase of the program needs to be divided as per technical abilities. idrw.org has been told that multiple phases will require multiple funds to be sanctioned as per requirements and it is a prerequisite to agree on how much funds will be required in each phase of the program. Entire program costs can vary from $5 to $10 billion since India also need to invest in creating some of the infrastructure and local manpower to not only produce these engines but also to maintain and provide spare and other overhaul support, it is difficult to agree to ballpark figure in early stages as the engine will enter production sometime in 2035 and beyond. People familiar with the talks who spoke to idrw.org claim that the budget that India is comfortable spending will get us an engine that is manufactured and tested in the OEM country but certification and production of this engine with precision tools and machinery will require another set of expertise that is simply not available in the country.

Indian Navy Plans to shift away from Ukrainian gas turbine engines,https://idrw.org/indian-navy-plans-to-shift-away-from-ukrainian-gas-turbine-engines/,"January 8, 2023","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. Indian Navy has decided to shift from gas turbine engines of Ukrainian origin for its next-generation warships programs and shift to its own indigenous marine gas turbine engines for the medium class of warships while bigger warships will still carry on using American or British gas turbine engines. Indian Navy has around 150 warships that are powered by Marine gas turbine engines that were supplied by the Ukrainian company Zorya-Mashproekt. Russia is working on its alternatives but Indian Navy is planning to develop local indigenous alternatives for the small to medium class of warships and seek license production for marine engines that are required for larger warships. Indian Navy has begun the process and is having talks with Industrial partners in the country that have expertise in designing engines that can be used to develop small to medium class Marine engines in the country. idrw.org has been told that many companies have shown interest in joint programs that the Navy wants to initiate and developing marine engines locally can be developed but the challenge will remain when it comes to gas turbine engines. DRDO’s Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine (KMGT) has been revived and work is on to develop an improved modified core that can support and sustain the power of 12MW for longer durations. DRDO is also planning to develop a Marine engine based on the 110-120kN Class of engine that will be developed for the country’s AMCA program soon. Navy and GTRE along with many private sector companies are confident that in the next decade, most of the Marine class of engines can be developed locally if appropriate funding is provided for research and development of the engines but developing a new class of gas turbine engines might take much longer and will need more investments."
OPINION : India should have joined the Tempest programme for the AMCA engine,https://idrw.org/opinion-india-should-have-joined-the-tempest-programme-for-the-amca-engine/,"January 8, 2023","SOURCE: RAJESH AHUJA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Britain, Italy and Japan are to cooperate in developing a sixth-generation fighter, Few details were available before the scheduled announcement beyond the project’s named Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the fact the partners say they plan to have the fighter ready by 2035. Japanese-European defence program will also see the development of a new engine advanced power and propulsion system that will see designing an electrical starter generator that was fully embedded in the core of a gas turbine engine, now known as the Embedded Electrical Starter Generator. The electrical embedded starter-generator will save space and provide the large amount of electrical power required by future fighters. Existing aircraft engines generate power through a gearbox underneath the engine, which drives a generator. In addition to adding moving parts and complexity, the space required outside the engine for the gearbox and generator makes the airframe larger, which is undesirable in a stealthy platform. Japan which had worked on successfully developing XF5, a low bypass turbofan engine and had even initiated work on the XF9 engine with 147.10 kN of Wet thrust still went back to Rolls-Royce to invest in the development of a new engine that will be powering its 6th generation fighter jet program. Jet engine and 6th gen fighter jet will enter production sometime in 2035-36 and it’s the same time frame when AMCA MkII with new high trust 110kN class of engine was supposed to enter production. India joining this program only for the engine for the AMCA program could have reduced not only its investment but could have also got its hands on the latest next-generation jet engine technology which many countries are not willing to transfer to India. The engine that will power Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) will be designed to support future power needs and the adoption of energy weapons on fighter jets that require immense power generation requirements. Engine based on M-88 or F-414 that were developed nearly 40 years to be used on a fighter jet that will enter production 15 years from now is clear cut short-sightedness of Indian military planners it needs to have an engine that is not good enough for 5th gen AMCA program but also good for 6th gen fighter jets program.

Over the year they have been several versions of the Saturn AL-31FP turbofan aircraft engine have been developed over the years, with various improvements and updates made to the design. Some of the improvements that have been made to the AL-31FP include: AL-31FP issues specifically with its core and time between overhauls (TBO) have been increased by India with help from Russia but Russians are no longer interested in fixing issues with the engine and bringing it to par with the western engine fuel economy and TBO and have been offering India to switch to the AL-41F-1S engines for its upgraded Su-30MKI program that has a host of improvements and features as mentioned below. There are several differences between the AL-41F-1S and the AL-31FP, including: Overall, the AL-41F-1S is a more powerful and advanced engine than the AL-31FP, with several features that improve its performance and efficiency. India with help of HAL, Midani and DRDO has worked on improving the performance of the engine locally that has done marginal engine improvements in specific areas such as Increasing the thrust: India has done the minor modification to the engines to produce more thrust, which could improve the performance of the aircraft. Enhancing fuel efficiency: India has made changes to the engines to make them more fuel efficient, which could reduce operating costs and extend the range of the aircraft. Improving durability: India has made changes to the engines to improve their reliability and service life. Upgrading the control systems: India has made improvements to the engine control systems to enhance the performance and operation of the engines. India has made so much investment in the development of a local supply system for this engine that it simply doesn’t want to get rid of it but it’s not at par with the AL-41F-1S engine and Russians have told that no more upgrades can be carried out to address this issue and investing in the new AL-41F-1S engine is a better bet but India due to IPR and other concerns have not involved any other engine manufacture to audit this engine and come with improvement plan where it will become hybrid engine with best of both worlds. French Safran has expertise in several areas related to aircraft engines, including design, development, manufacturing, and maintenance. Depending on the specific needs of the situation, Safran could potentially offer a range of services to help address issues with the AL-31FP.

Uttam Mk3 will be replacing a legendary Radar and it will be the biggest and most powerful radar that will be developed by India to date that will come with impressive performance and also allow the Su-30 fleet to remain relevant for the next 30 years. Su-30 aircraft is huge aircraft so is its nose cone that can accommodate an AESA antenna with a small solid-state transmit/receive module (TRM) nearly twice the size of the current Uttam Mk2 (912 TRM). To explain it better a small comparison with the Shenyang J-16 which is a direct copy of the Su-27 is equipped with AESA Radar that has a 1760 TRM but Indian scientists in recent years largely due to help from Israel have been able to demonstrate that they can have better packaging density than Chinese AESA radar. Uttam Mk3 can support TRM from 2000 to 2400 which can be accomplished with the use of gallium nitride (GaN) wide bandgap semiconductors. While the Su-30 Nose cone can accommodate such large TRMs it’s not clear if the AL-31F engines can provide enough power to operate this radar at optimal levels. LRDE and IAF might opt for a conservative TRM module antenna not to stress engines for additional power and might opt for Uttam Mk3 that can accommodate TRMs in a conservative range from 1500-1800. Uttam Mk3 specifications might be made public sometime in 2024 when radar enters the testing phase and it will be clear if LRDE and IAF went for conservative radar or went big."

OPINION : After messed up HJT-36 program can HAL deliver on HLFT-42?,https://idrw.org/opinion-after-messed-up-hjt-36-program-can-hal-deliver-on-hlft-42/,"February 12, 2023","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Subsonic intermediate jet trainer aircraft designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) flew for the first time exactly 20 years ago in 2003 but it has still not entered into production. HJT-36 Sitara which was to replace ageing Kiran Stage-II Trainer aircraft in the Indian Air Force (IAF) nearly a decade ago is nowhere close to entering production and frankly, no one cares about the program anymore as focus and training doctrine in the last few decades has changed and shift now is clearly to have a supersonic jet trainer and days of sub-sonic trainer jets are more or less over. HAL Claims HLFT-42 is the ‘Next Gen Supersonic Trainer’ that is under development and the plan is to equip it with modern avionics like Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA), Electronic Warfare (EW) Suite, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) with Fly by Wire (FBW) control system. HAL doesn’t want to repeat the fiasco of the HJT-36 for the HLFT-42 program and is going for the tried and tested design of the HF-24 fighter jet that flew in the early 60s and was in service with IAF till the mid-’80s. HF-24 was a stable Mach 2 capable design even though it never went supersonic due to underpowered engines. HLFT-42 seems to have borrowed the mid-fuselage section along with wings from the HF-24 program and mated it with the front fuselage section from the Tejas Mk1 program to maintain commonality and to reduce overhaul cost of validating design in repeated wind tunnel testing. HAL is following tried and tested formula that it has borrowed from the HTT-40 (Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40) program that was designed after carefully studying flaws of the HPT-32 Deepak and reworking its design instead of going for a clean slate design. HLFT-42 can repeat the successful formula of the HTT-40 program but will it be successful it only decided how the program is executed and the timeframe required from the first flight to clearance of final airworthy certifications.

India’s Top 5 Upcoming Weapons systems Due in 2023,https://idrw.org/indias-top-5-upcoming-weapons-systems-due-in-2023/,"December 30, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG 2023 will see the development of a lot of weapons systems that will be rolled out from DRDO programs, HAL and other associated defence programs. idrw.org has compiled a list of missile systems that are in the advanced stages of development and are expected to make their debut in 2023. ALFA-S: The ALFA-S (Air-Launched Flexible Asset) is a swarming loitering munition being developed by New Space Research & Technologies and HAL. We learned in 2022 that ALFA-S had completed wind tunnel testing as well as Internal Combustion Powertrain testing. A POD that can house four ALFA-S has also been developed, so testing could begin as early as 2023. Nag Mk II: The DRDO has begun work on an improved variant of the Nag ATGM, which will have a longer range and improved performance, as well as minor changes to its launch platform. Nag Mk II will use some of the technology that has already been developed for the SANT and Helina ATGMs for the Helicopter launch. Zorawar Light Tank: DRDO has partnered with private sector firm L&T to build the first Light Tank under Project Zorwar, for which funds have already been allocated. The DRDO intends to roll out the vehicle’s prototype by the end of 2023, which will be used for developmental and user trials beginning in 2024. S4* (Star): India’s second S4 class submarine is nearing completion in its dry dock, and it will be moved to the outer fitment area in 2023 to receive additional equipment. While it may not be ready, it is still an accomplishment because it means that nearly 80% of the dry dock work has been completed and the submarine may be ready for basin and seat trials in 2025. Tejas Mk2: India’s plans to develop a larger sibling to the LCA-Tejas Mk1 programme are already one year behind schedule due to the program’s late clearance of the funds. ADA and HAL have promised that the first aircraft will be delivered by the end of 2023, but there is no guarantee that it will not be delayed until 2024, so we will stick with the current timeline that the delivery will take place in 2023 and will be regarded as a significant development in the Indian aerospace sector."

DRDO-GTRE plans to have a certified Kaveri Dry engine by 2025 that will be cleared for production and once the engine is certified decks will be cleared for the development of the IUSAV prototype. idrw.org has been told that IUSAV and AMCA programs are crucial next-generation platforms that will work in tandem as manned and unmanned platforms for revolving aerial warfare. IUSAV and AMCA being stealth platforms will be India’s first line of Aerial platforms that will be in charge of breaching enemy air defense’s and carrying out ground striking on enemy targets and also establishing air superiority in conflict zones. Both programs are planned to take off simultaneously so that both can enter production sometime in 2031-32."
OPINION : Can India ignore the predicted rise in Chinese Nuclear arsenal?,https://idrw.org/opinion-can-india-ignore-the-predicted-rise-chinese-nuclear-arsenal/,"January 1, 2023","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG For Decades China was believed to have a relatively small nuclear arsenal compared to other nuclear-armed states, with estimates ranging from around 280 to 320 nuclear warheads. However, China has been steadily modernizing its nuclear weapons, including the development of new types of nuclear missiles and submarine-launched nuclear missiles. Like other nuclear-armed states, China’s nuclear weapons program has been a source of concern and tension in international relations. The country has faced criticism for not being more transparent about its nuclear capabilities and for not participating in arms control negotiations, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It is not accurate to say that the Pentagon has released a report stating that China will possess 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. While the Pentagon does release regular reports on the state of China’s military, I am not aware of any recent report that makes such a specific prediction about China’s nuclear weapons stockpile. It is important to note that making predictions size of a country’s nuclear arsenal is inherently uncertain and dependent on a range of factors, including the country’s strategic goals and priorities, its technological capabilities, and international developments. It is not possible to accurately predict with certainty the size of China’s nuclear arsenal in the future will be but it should be a matter of concern for its neighbours especially India with whom it has troubled border issues. India being a nuclear-armed state which has a nuclear weapons program that dates back to the 1970s. The country conducted its first nuclear test in 1974 and has since conducted several more nuclear tests. It is believed that India has a stockpile of around 130-140 nuclear warheads, although the exact size of the stockpile is not known for certain as India’s nuclear weapons program is not transparent nor officially nuclear stockpile acknowledged. India like China has adopted NFU when it comes to nuclear strikes. India’s “no first use” (NFU) nuclear doctrine is a policy that states that India will not use nuclear weapons first in a conflict. This means that India would only consider using nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack on its territory or its armed forces. The policy was first announced by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998 after India conducted a series of nuclear tests. India’s NFU policy has been seen as an important aspect of its nuclear deterrence strategy, as it helps to clarify the circumstances under which India would consider using nuclear weapons and can help to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict. However, some have questioned the viability of the NFU policy, arguing that it could be difficult to determine whether a nuclear attack has occurred and that the policy could limit India’s options in a crisis. India is in the process of developing its nuclear triad. The country already has land-based nuclear missiles, including the Agni series of intermediate-range and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles, and is developing aircraft-based nuclear weapons, including the development of a nuclear-capable version of the Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet. India is also building a nuclear-powered submarine, the INS Arihant, which will be capable of launching nuclear missiles. Once the INS Arihant and its sister ships like S3, S4 and S4 star become operational, India will have a complete nuclear triad but it will require more nukes for its nuclear submarine fleet for which it also needs to factor in that the Chinese arsenal will also be growing in the next 15 years.

OPINION : Indian Defence Export Policies need a makeover,https://idrw.org/opinion-indian-defence-export-policies-need-a-makeover/,"December 31, 2022","SOURCE: DEEPAK HILORI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG India has the potential to be a significant player in the global defence export market. The country has a large and well-developed domestic defence industry, with both state-owned and private-sector companies involved in the production of a wide range of defence equipment, including military aircraft, tanks, artillery, and naval vessels. In recent years, the Indian government has made efforts to promote the defence export industry, including easing restrictions on defence exports and establishing a defence export organization to promote Indian defence products overseas. Several factors contribute to India’s potential for growth in the defence export market. These include: A large and growing domestic defence market: India is one of the largest defence spenders in the world, and this has led to the development of a strong domestic defence industry. This industry has the potential to produce equipment for both domestic and export markets. A strategic location: India is located in a strategically important region, and its proximity to major markets in Asia and the Middle East makes it well-positioned to serve as a hub for defence exports. Strong research and development capabilities: India has a well-developed science and technology sector, and its defence industry has access to a skilled and educated workforce. This has allowed the country to develop advanced defence technologies that are of interest to foreign buyers. Growing international partnerships: India has developed strong defence partnerships with several countries, including the United States, Russia, and France, which have opened up new export opportunities. Overall, India’s defence export industry has significant potential for growth, but it will depend on several factors, including the country’s ability to produce high-quality defence products that meet the needs of foreign buyers, and its ability to compete with other major defence exporters. There are several factors that the Indian government considers when developing defence export policies. These include: Overall, the Indian government’s defence export policies are designed to balance the need to promote the defence export industry with the need to protect national security and meet international obligations.

India’s Top 5 Upcoming Missiles Due in 2023,https://idrw.org/indias-top-5-upcoming-missiles-due-in-2023/,"December 30, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG As the world enters the remaining days of 2022, India has enjoyed a stellar year in terms of evaluating missile systems that have raised its bar on the world stage. Nevertheless, India is not finished yet, and 2023 will see more missile tests and the going to unveil of newer missile defence systems that have been in development for some time idrw.org has compiled a list of missile systems that are in advanced stages of development and are expected to make their developmental flight debuts in 2023. Astra Mk2: In 2022, We got confirmation that India has commenced captive and realise trials of the upcoming Astra Mk2, beyond visual range air to Air missile that has a claimed range of 160+km. Mk2 will be the first Indian air-to-air missile to feature AESA-based Seeker that will improve its ability to hit targets in the last few seconds when engaging a target and will usher in India’s entry into an elite club of countries that have capabilities to hit aerial targets at such ranges. Rudram-2: Captive flight trials of the Air-Launched RudraM-II that has a range of 300km when the missile is launched from 15km altitude at Mach 0.8. was completed in 2022 and in the same year, tenders were issued for the supply of airframes, IIR seekers, warheads and other components for the fabrication of initial batches of missiles system to carry out developmental trials of the missile. By end of 2023, we will likely see the first developmental trials of the weapon systems from Su-30MKI aircraft. NASM–MR: Naval Anti-Ship Missile-Medium Range, an anti-ship missile with a range of 150+km, has been developed for several years now, and according to tender issues in 2022, the weapon system will be under fabrication soon and likely will be prepared for captive and flight release trials in 2023, possibly with a developmental test carried out by the end of 2023 or early 2024. VEDA: Vehicle for Defence Application (Veda) is a little-discussed programme, but we all know that it is a Defense satellite launch vehicle that will be used to inject Nano-satellites that can be configured for use in a variety of configurations for Defense utilities at a moments notice. Road mobile Defense satellite launch vehicles will provide India with the ability to launch on-demand from nearly any stretch of land that can be used for such launches, particularly in the event of war and a shortage of current Defense satellites. Experimental trials of VEDA are likely to commence in 2023 since it is based on established missile systems like K-4 and Agni-5, India already has the technology for it. K-5: There were numerous false alarms in 2022 that India’s secret submarine-launched ballistic missile programme had added another member to its K Family, but this was not the case. K-5 has been in development since 2015, and it is nearing or has already begun a few short-range trials, but there is no confirmation. With the emergence of the S4 and S4*(Star) Class of submarines, K-5 developmental trials in 2023 are highly likely, as it is India’s longest SLBM with a range of 5000-6000+km."

OPINION : IAF cant wish a Secret Santa to iron out its ‘critical deficiencies’,https://idrw.org/opinion-iaf-cant-wish-a-secret-santa-to-iron-out-its-critical-deficiencies/,"December 26, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari has pointed out ‘critical deficiencies’ being faced by the Indian Air Force (IAF), such as the shortage of fighter squadrons and force multipliers. Whether it is fighter jet procurement or procurement of force multipliers, IAF has been not only lagged but has unable to fix its procurement policies that no files seem to be moving in any direction even after years of knowing that squadrons numbers are down and need to be brought up in desired period or it will play catch up to its arch rivals China and Pakistan for decades to come. The IAF currently has 31 fighter squadrons, while the authorized strength is 42. As some squadrons have been phased out in recent years, the number has decreased. There is an urgent need to accelerate inductions to close the gap, especially since China is actively bolstering its air power. IAF needs to fast-track its Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) Programme for which it needs to start sending Request for Proposal (RFP) that has been pending for the last 4 years and soon will be entering its 5th year. MRFA that was previously known as MMRCA has completed nearly 23 years since the Kargil war and the circus seems to be not coming to end anytime soon as Government doesn’t want to admit that it simply doesn’t have $25-30 Billion to fund procurement of 114 jets and IAF doesn’t want to admit that any cheaper or local produced fighter jet will be good enough in a combat zone. Modi government promised to kick start Made in India program has been sitting on the MRFA requirements for 8 years now with a deal for 36 Dassault Rafale only coming as its biggest achievement. IAF and Modi government needs to sit down and see how they can decrease these ‘critical deficiencies’ in the shortest possible time it needs to come up with out of box ideas, either they procure 60 Rafale directly from Dassault and procure more Tejas with more upgraded technologies either as Mk1B or fast track Mk2 program to bridge this ‘critical deficiencies’ Disclaimer : Articles published under ” MY TAKE ” are articles written by Guest Writers and Opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

"OPINION : Indian Navy Repeating 1990sMistake, Must Order 3 More Scorpenes, Skip P75I, Order Total 4 Carriers",https://idrw.org/opinion-indian-navy-repeating-1990smistake-must-order-3-more-scorpenes-skip-p75i-order-total-4-carriers/,"December 23, 2022","SOURCE: JOYDEEP GHOSH / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Looks like Indian Navy is repeating 1990s mistake. After the fist 2 Shishumar class submarines were built and delivered from Germany and 2 were built at Mazagaon Docks in India with last one rolling out in 1990. Once that was done the human resources, supply chain, setup all sat idle. Even after MDL pleaded with Indian Navy and government to issue order for atleast 1 more that expertise gained is not lost, the Indian Navy and government refused and by early 2000s everything was lost. Indian Navy and government instead started looking for new submarine in 2003 and we got Scorpène, the last of which is set to roll out next year. Now we are sitting on piles of Type 209 ToT related document. If Indian Navy and government had ordered newer batches of 3 Type 209 subs every 5 years applying better technologies progressively, we wouldn’t have ever faced shortage as we see today and we wouldn’t have needed the Scorpène either with total 16 Type 209. Work on AIP going on side by side would have allowed one of the submarines to be used as test bed and after validation we would have started equipping our submarines with AIP by now. We can still test our homegrown AIP on the Type 209 starting 2023 and completing it by 2025. As situation stands logic dictates Indian Navy and government must skip P75I and go for 9 submarines under P76 and ordering 3 more Scorpène submarine under P75. That way the project cost will be amortised, human resources/expertise will not be lost and supply chain will be busy till 2032. In the meantime, the total 9 Scorpène submarine under P75 can be retrofitted with AIP during mid-life upgrade starting 2025 making them truly Super Scorpène equipped with torpedo tube launched SLCM. That way Indian Navy will have a homegrown AIP ready for P76 ready as well by the time submarine is chosen in 2032. Another mistake looks like Indian Navy is repeating from 1990s is by not ordering a sister ship of INS Vikrant immediately after it was commissioned into the Indian Navy. Ideally the moment INS Vikrant was decommissioned, order for a 40000-ton carrier should have been given to CSL. It’s a different matter that Russia offered INS Vikramaditya way back in 1995, if the offer was accepted then itself and the ship ordered we would have bought it at much less lost than what we gave for it in 2004 after letting it rot for 8 more years. Anyways the sister ship can be titled INS Viraat and a STOBAR carrier. Many may say a STOBAR doesn’t allow jets to take off with full weapon load or fuel. We can overcome that shortcoming by going for 4 aircraft carriers conventionally powered (for now), out of which 2 need to be of INS Vikrant class and other 2 of INS Vikramaditya class. It will help amortize the project investment made in training personnel, setting up machines and more. 1st carrier takes care of western seaboard, 2nd carrier takes care of eastern seaboard, 3rd carrier in repairs and 4th carrier takes care of remaining part of Northern Indian Ocean left untouched by the 2 carriers and the entire Southern Indian Ocean. Southern Indian Ocean is a massive fish, oil, gas, and mineral rich area. Do note China has already forayed into this area and is practically robbing the fish in the area with huge fishing trawlers. Building a 3rd aircraft carrier or IAC2 of just 65000-ton doesn’t make sense if its’ not fully capable. Meaning it must have a single fuel lifetime 250MW nuclear reactor. It should be able to carry and launch 3 E2D Hawkeye type aircraft, as well as launch atleast 40 fully armed and fueled fixed wing fighters, with 12 to 15 helos. All this can’t be accommodated in 65000-ton carrier, it must be atleast 75000-ton carrier same as what France is building to replace the Charles de Gaulle carrier. Problem is India still can’t build a single fuel lifetime nuclear reactor. The 190MW nuclear reactors being designed for future 6 SSNs & 3 S5-class SSBNs are still in concept and no sign yet that these will be single fuel lifetime nuclear reactor or whether atleast one will be ready by 2032. Even if built, that reactor will have to be re-modelled for carrier. All this will be atleast 15 years’ time give or take and is highly cost prohibitive. In the meantime, CSL can easily build another 40000-ton INS Vikrant class carrier and 2nd 45000-ton INS Vikramaditya class carrier. To make up for the shortfall in not being to takeoff with full weapon and fuel load, the best option can be that fighters’ jets are launched with full weapons load and 50% fuel load. Just after takeoff midair they can be refueled by buddy-buddy refueling or with an unmanned refueler UAV. This way even conventionally powered aircraft carriers can operate and launch fully armed and fueled fixed wing fighters. We can have a 250 MW nuclear powered CATOBAR carrier once INS Vikramaditya is decommissioned in 2040. Indian Navy and Government must give these a serious thinking.

OPINION : Why India has not been able to crack the warship Export market ?,https://idrw.org/opinion-why-india-has-not-been-able-to-crack-the-warship-export-market/,"December 20, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Defense minister Rajnath Singh at the formal induction of the second of the four Visakhapatnam class destroyers, indigenously designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau and built by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDL) said that India will do shipbuilding for the world. India which has been designing warships like frigates and destroyers for the last 40 years is yet to sell such large displacement vessels while it has had some success with the sale of fast patrol boats and offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) up to 1300-tonne but has not been able to crack niche segment for Naval warships like frigates and destroyers for some time now and its crucial India gets its act right if it wants to be in top exporters of defense equipment in next 15-20 years. Indian warships like frigates have a very competitive price point that makes them better than European frigates in the segment but can’t compete with Chinese frigates in the export market that undercut Indian frigates in almost all criteria. Chinese Type 054A frigate as an estimated cost of around $350 million and are mass-produced with the adoption of modular construction methods that allows multiple shipyards to manufacture them at speeds that are nearly impossible to replicate what is also impressive is that Chinese shipyards can manage three shift construction schedule that allows them to deliver Type 054A class frigate within 4 years after concluding its internal trials that include weapons trials all in the timeframe of 4 years. India’s Nilgiri-class frigate which is still under construction has an estimated cost of around $500 million per ship the first ship will come out in 2023 nearly 6 years after its keel was laid in 2017 and the second ship is expected to be ready in 2024 nearly 5 years after its keel was laid in 2019. In the last 35 or so of building warships in the country, India has been able to bring down construction time by 3 years down from 9 years to 6 years but it is still slow as per International standards where the average construction time for frigate class warships never exceeds 4 years. The cost of an Indian frigate and a Russian Frigate usually hovers around the $450-500 million mark so it makes India quite favorable in the export market in the Russian sphere of influence. Just for comparison, other frigates that are currently under production like a British frigate will cost around $536 million, and the French FREMM frigate at around $553.9 million. Indian shipyards need to adopt modular constructions and reduce the manhour that is required to build warships in the country and go robotics so has to reduce labor cost that breaching 30% for every warship that is made in India and bring it to a Chinese average of 22%.

Nearly 18 years ago Indian Navy had expressed interest in acquiring six E-2C Hawkeye carrier-based airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft for its Two aircraft carriers but questions were raised if Hawkeye can operate from smaller Indian aircraft carriers that are not equipped with catapult systems nor has deck space like U.S Aircraft carriers for takeoff. Northrop Gruman, the makers of the Hawkeye AEW&C had carried out detailed studies and had told that India-specific varaint can be developed that can operate from a 45000-ton aircraft carrier that India operates. Later Boeing also pitched its 737-AEW&C Wedgetail which can be used as a shore-based airborne early warning aircraft that can cover carrier battle groups. Indian Navy is monitoring the Netra AEW&C Mk2 program that will be executed by DRDO to be mounted on the Airbus A321 platform for the Indian Air Force. idrw.org has been told that locally developing a deck-based AEW&C aircraft is highly unlikely but a shore-based Netra AEW&C Mk2 program customized for the Indian Navy’s requirements is a possibility or the Navy might have a relook at the E-2D Hawkeye program."

DRDO had started to plan to reduce the weight of the 50-tonne Agni-5, for which it has been working on replacing its older, heavier subsystems such as hydraulic to electro-mechanical actuators in favor of lighter, more reliable ones, many of which were managed by replacing maraging steel with lightweight composite materials. Recent Media reports confirm that Agni-V has received a 20% weight reduction which means Agni-5 MkII now has a lunch mass of 40000kg with 1100kg nuclear payload that can deliver a warhead to a target that is 7000km. Agni-VI which was supposed to be the successor of the Agni-V with a range of 6000km with a similar payload is now negated with the development of the MkII. Agni-5 MkII which is an improved variant of the Agni-5 will allow New Delhi to beat the heat that it had received when it started developmental tests of the missile that can threaten many countries not only in Asia-Pacific but also in Europe. MkII with a range of 7000km can easily hit targets as far as 8000-9000km with a lighter payload and in a way negates the need for the Agni-V that allowed India to expand its sphere of nuclear strike capabilities without getting backlash that might have been unleashed if India had developed Agni-VI instead of Agni-5 MkII."

A report in ” The Week ” claimed that its source hinted that it was a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) test. “It may not be a test of the Agni 5 and can be something much bigger. But whatever it is, it adds one big feather to the cap of India.” Most hypersonic glide vehicles have been designed with a ballistic missile for the first stage, An HGV’s ability to maneuver as it descends into thicker and thicker air allows it to be both more accurate and unpredictable. When the vehicle’s wings begin generating lift as it reaches the upper wisps of the atmosphere, it gains the ability to roll and maneuver. This means it can alter its trajectory to aim at a different target than its orbit suggested, or to evade an anti-ballistic missile. The HGV had been identified as one of the 18 major platforms for industry-led design and development under various routes. DRDO successfully demonstrated its hypersonic air-breathing scramjet technology with the flight test of the Hypersonic Technology Demonstration Vehicle (HSTDV) on September 7, 2020."

India’s need for further development of ICBMs or successors of the Agni-V shouldn’t be a priority since India now has a stable road-mobile ICBM that can be hidden anywhere in India and when required fired at any major city in China. India needs to focus much more on the development of land-based hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles to up its offensive capabilities and can’t risk falling behind in its next-gen weapon system that China is progressing at rapid speed and already has deployed these weapon systems. India which will soon start work on bigger S5 class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines need to focus on getting its long-range submarine-launched ballistic missile arsenal operational in the next 10 years as fears of war always remain but India might also need to fight a war that is far from its shores. India should accelerate the development of the K-6SLBM which has a reported range of 6000km and start work on the K-7 or K-8 that can hit targets as far as 10000-12000km if India wants these submarines to be well hidden that it can provide India with second strike capabilities that it desires from its Nuclear command.

A recent study on the Ukrainian UAVs and drones initially, success shows that the average flight time of Turkish Bayraktar TB2 in the later part of the war was down to just 6 flights before it could eventually be shot down. But when it comes to India, we have the right to bet our money on loitering ammunition but we can’t discount combat drones of our enemies, especially considering that Chinese armed UAVs are cheap and are made in factories that have no supply chain issues and can ramp up production overnight in case of war. Indian scenario reminded me of a quote, attributed to Stalin, that’s stuck with me: “Quantity has a Quality of its own”. Chinese armed drones might find it difficult to break the security grid of the Indian air defense system in the first phase of the war but with numerical superiority, and with ability to quickly replace lost ones, they will keep trying till it completely overwhelms Indian Air defense systems that India will not be able to produce surface to air missiles and its support systems to replace one that is lost in the battlefield at space pace. China and Pakistan both are relying on Armed UAVs to overwhelm Indian air defense systems in many sectors and to also find locations of the mobile air defense systems. India needs to invest more in its air defense systems and also expand the scale of its production so that it can be produced at faster rates in event of a war. Unlike Ukraine which received weapons from aboard and continues to receive them, India might not have the same luxury in the middle of a war so it should work on multiple public-private sector collaborations to make sure that its air defense grid is not only formidable but also can last for months in case of a prolonged war."

Often HAL has been accused of rushing to meet its production target by compromising on the quality of work. The hawk-132 AJT program was such an example when programs suffered several delays due to poor workmanship and often delivered aircraft was not airworthy and had to be reinspected and many issues had to be fixed by IAF’s BRO to make them airworthy again. LCA-Tejas program also suffered considerable delays due to HALs failure to ramp up the production line even when the appropriate funds were provided. It took 6 years for HAL to supply 32 aircraft from 2016 onwards with an average of just over 5 aircraft in a year even though it often claimed that it had a production capacity of 8 aircraft per year. After the start of the second LCA division, again HAL made tall claims that it can now make 16 LCA-Tejas aircraft per year but it still has not delivered even single LCA-Trainers that went into production in 2021 out of the 18 that were ordered.

HLFT-42 seems to be borrowing a lot from HF-24, at least in its wings, and air intake design. HF-24 design was very stable and the airframe supported Mach 2 speeds, but it never reached its potential due to a lack of suitable engines to power them. HLFT-42 inspiration might be HF-24 which was a naturally stable design but choosing HF-24 as a base also helps mitigate risks of overdependence on the flight controls (rudder, elevator, ailerons) to remain stable which will indirectly reduce the cost of the aircraft. HLFT-42 seems to have borrowed at least the front section from the Tejas that will ensure that the aircraft nose cone will have enough room to house an AESA Radar and inflight-refueling probe so that it can also be used as a light combat aircraft. HF-24 which flew without onboard radar never was designed to have one so it was a wise decision to go for a nose cone that is inspired by the Tejas program."

While Meteor, beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM), is standard on the Rafale fighter jets, It is also expensive, and to supplement it Indian Rafale fighter jets carry MICA BVRAAMs that are considered inferior to the Astra Mk1 that outscores it in range and operational parameters."

French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu who was in India and even visited the indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant hinted at providing various concessions to the Indian side. idrw.org has been told that Dassault and France will be offering Rafale Marine at a much more discounted price and have offered to upgrade it to the same standards as IAF’s Rafale fleet with more Indigenous Indian content. Rafale Marine is available only in a single-seat version for which France is ready to offer 3 used Twin seater Rafale, an Ex-French Air force variant to be used as an advanced training aircraft at a discounted price, even though it doesn’t have reinforced undercarriage to carry out carrier take-offs and landings. Rafale Marine is also incapable of folding its wings which could have huge ramifications for the Indian Navy due to limited space on the aircraft carrier. Dassault and France have highlighted commonalities between the air force and Marine variants due to which India could save a lot on the infrastructure needed to support the F-18E/F Super Hornet fleet. Indian Navy is likely to take a final decision after studying both the proposals and after going through the evaluation report that was done off a ski-jump facility in Goa earlier this year."

B-21 will be replacing ultra-expensive B-1B and B-2 in long run in the USAF fleet with the need for 70 units it will have a pretty long production run too. B-2, a highly capable Bomber with stealth characteristics that was billed at $2 billion after adjusting inflation in today’s rate of 2022, B-21 raider will have a unit cost of just $650 million per unit which is nearly 1/4th of what B-2 could have cost exchequer today if its production line was reopened. B-21 even if it is cleared for export not many countries will be in a position to place orders for B-21 not only due to cost but also because of its operational and other annual maintenance costs that are not associated with the unit costs. B-21 which will have a nuclear carrier role in USAF might come missing in an Export version which could be perfectly fine for non-nuclear countries like Japan, Australia, and Korea but will not be okay for countries like India that might consider it for only such roles as it is facing border issues with two nuclear countries in its vicinity.

It was not long into the LCA-LIFT program before HAL seems to have realized that it was trying to swim against the tide and announced plans to develop a Hindustan Lead-in Fighter Trainer (HLFT-42) aircraft that likely will have a much more traditional swept wing design which is often found in the LIFT aircraft types around the world. In delta configuration, High drag force at low speeds is often observed and can become handy for a pilot that is not well-versed in handling the jet. The Delta wing has no benefits at slow speed and maneuverability as that will come from powered vector exhaust and not the wings, The benefit of the Delta wing at high speed is not what the operator might want when training a pilot who is still getting familiar with sub-sonic speeds. A delta wing also comes with the side effect of drag, and both lift and drag increase with the angle of attack until a point where drag greatly exceeds lift.

Tejas MkII Rollout already has been pushed to 2024 and will commence delivery in 2030-31 which means all development flight trials will be completed in the next 6 years this seems to be way too aggressive since Mk1 developmental flight trials lasted from 2001 till 2016 when the first squadron with IOC-II configuration was raised and Mk2 carries a whole lot of major changes to its avionics and systems that have little or no connection with the Mk1 program. Mk2 gets New Radar, Onboard oxygen generator, Internal EW suite, Side stick controls, Full Touch enabled Wide Area Display screens, a New engine, and a host of other features that are simply not on the Mk1 program. While some might argue that most of the tech has been developed and has completed many developmental trials but until all the proposed systems and supplements are not tested together it’s very difficult to know what issues might crop up when they are finally put together. AMCA program is the most complex of the two since it is a generation part and needs to be best in its class for it to be classified as a 5th gen fighter aircraft for a country that had limited access to 5th-generation technology. AMCA program will be executed through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that will see the participation of private sector companies which is so wrong since SPV should have been used to execute the Tejas MkII program first so that the Private sector can build on hands-on experience they had first on a 4.5 gen fighter program that could have smoothened out the transition in the AMCA program. India is yet to establish the SPV model for the AMCA program and rumors around are that not many companies are keen to be partners in the program due to the complexity of the project and also due to lack of experience in handling such programs in the past. Many existing component suppliers of the Mk1 program have limited experience in manufacturing airframes and no experience in putting together an airworthy jet. Both Tejas Mk2 and AMCA programs are running on promises made by ADA and HAL that they will get it done but the client (IAF) is yet to see how they plan to execute the program without facing delays in the programs. ADA needs to reduce developmental flight timeline by ensuring that computer simulations of the jets they have designed for the entire flight regime do not show off any design issues and HAL needs to ensure that its Management skills are optimum to get components and parts sourced in time that is ready to set up a new age production plant for complex fighters like AMCA."

India issues NOTAM for Very Long range Ballistic Missile Test,https://idrw.org/india-issues-notam-for-very-long-range-ballistic-missile-test/,"November 30, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG India has issued Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) for a launch of an experimental flight vehicle in the Bay of Bengal for the period from 15-16 Dec 2022 as per information provided by Twitter user Damien Symon@detresfa_. The designated area for the NOTAM is 5400 km in length which indicates it might be a test of the Agni-5 Ballistic Missile Missile. speculation is also that it might be a test of the new K5 SLBM that has a range of 5500km, but it is most likely the case. India often carried out the Agni-5 test with reduced range but the 5400 km range can hit the entire Chinese mainland from even the southernmost tip of India which might be one of the reasons it is been tested for the first time to its full range."
France offers Pumpjet propulsion technology for Indian SSN Program,https://idrw.org/france-offers-pumpjet-propulsion-technology-for-indian-ssn-program/,"November 30, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Warship Design Bureau (WDB), India’s nodal design agency when it comes to warships and submarines is in charge of India’s 1st gen Nuclear Attack submarine program and one of the technologies it wants to incorporate is the Pumpjet propulsion technology that comes with unique advantages of its own but is also costlier and more complex than a traditional propeller. While the final configuration of India’s Nuclear Attack submarine program is yet to be finalized, the Navy and WDB have started testing small-scale models of the Pumpjet propulsion technology for research and development purposes that might eventually lead to manufacturing of the full-scale Pumpjet propulsion for the submarines. Pump-jets technology is itself a fascinating mix of material science, mechanical engineering, and hydrodynamics, India will need to do a lot more in research and development before it can develop one on its own and it seems the French have been watching the Indian SSN program closely and has offered to share its Pump-jets technology with Transfer of Technology if India procures their submarines under Project-75I. British Astute-class SSN, upcoming American Columbia-class SSN submarine, and French Barracuda-class SSN submarine are all fitted with pump-jet propulsion that allows for higher speeds without noisy cavitation. pump-jet propulsion is becoming the most widely used propulsion technology for nuclear attack submarines than for the smaller conventional attack submarines due to its weight and its massive power requirements. Indian Navy also is fixated on having pump-jet propulsion for its SSN program but the tech is much more complex and will require much more investment to develop locally."

DRDO plans to work on a new air-to-air missile,https://idrw.org/drdo-plans-to-work-on-a-new-air-to-air-missile/,"November 28, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG The Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) plans to develop a new air-to-air missile that will have a range greater than the present (Astra Mk2) but will have a similar range to the air-breathing ramjet air-to-air missile (Astra Mk3 ) that is under development. Air-breathing ramjet propulsion beats traditional solid fuel in terms of range but is too costly to acquire in large numbers. DRDO plans to develop a new air-to-air missile that has traditional solid fuel propulsion but with a wider dimension that will allow it to reach the 280km+ mark while costing half as much that could have cost for an Air-breathing ramjet propulsion BVRAAM. DRDO already has developed Astra Mk1 with a range of 110km and Astra Mk2 with a range of 160km which is pending trials and is working on Astra Mk3, which has a range of 340km for targets such as AWACS/Tankers/FRA. Astra Mk2 uses a Dual-Pulse motor and Mk3 uses an Air-breathing ramjet propulsion motor. DRDO plans to use develop a Multi-Pulse Motor (MPM) solid-propellant rocket motor that will allow three or more pulses on a single motor to achieve such range while keeping unit cost on the lower side."

OPINION : Saudi joining BRICS will be game changer ?,https://idrw.org/opinion-saudi-joining-brics-will-be-game-changer/,"November 28, 2022","SOURCE: RYAN GEORGE KOYITHARA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG A global trend aimed at building an alternative economic and financial system parallel to the current one was intensified by the Russia-Ukraine war. The BRICS nations —Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—which together account for 41% of the world’s population—adding the GCC countries. These nations also make up 23% of the world’s economy and 18% of its trade, reflecting their proportional significance to the world economy as a whole. Saudi Arabia recently submitted an application to join the group, and it is perceived that current members heartily will welcome the move. Also being discussed is the possibility of the UAE and Turkey joining, which would fundamentally alter the balance of power in the world and contribute to a more stable system. The three countries’ expected entrance will bring about a significant shift that will favour the East. Saudi Arabia, with its enormous energy potential, the UAE, as a major international financial and commercial hub, and Turkey, with its geographic location, industrial development, and technological advancement, will significantly increase their influence over the group and rebalance power between the East and the West. It goes without saying that the world will become even more divided into two sizable blocs if the BRICS grows stronger. The Western camp, which now has sway over the global economy’s levers, will take the lead in the first. A major development that would have a significant impact on international relations is the addition of oil-producing nations, which would give the group 31% of the world’s oil production, simply because the world will witness the merging of the biggest energy producers and consumers. The Saudi Arabian situation is both puzzling and fascinating. In West Asia, Saudi Arabia has long been a key friend of the US. However, the relationship has had a roller-coaster ride over the past few months. The intention of Saudi Arabia, a long-time US ally, to join the BRICS tells the West that the world is becoming more multipolar. This is particularly pertinent given that the US was unable to convince its Middle Eastern partners to join other OPEC+ nations in limiting oil production and depriving Russia of its energy revenues. The BRICS countries announced the establishment of a parallel bank with a $150 billion capital to compete with the IMF, dealing another blow to the west. Additionally, BRICS is a little “perplexed” about growing its membership. It lacks a definite expansion policy. Previously, several of the members have rejected such initiatives. Saudi Arabia would be welcomed by Russia and China with open arms, but other BRICS members might not feel the same way. Saudi Arabia and India have deep ties. But, India might not be open to the notion of broadening the bloc at this time. India, Brazil, and South Africa worry that other nations may make similar demands. The five founding countries of the BRICS must agree unanimously on its expansion. Political and economic ties, notably those involving oil, exist between Saudi Arabia and India. India can express its opinion on Saudi Arabia’s membership more easily than, say, Argentina, which has strained ties with New Delhi. It is worth mentioning that regional powers in their regions make up the BRICS, and they are apprehensive of their adversaries joining the group. The existing economic system and its components, which were established 80 years ago, are no longer viable due to massive changes in the economic and geopolitical balance of power, the emergence of new economic powers, and the demise of others. This truth must be properly understood if the world is to avoid further conflicts impeding an equitable global order."
OPINION : Vijayanta Revisited,https://idrw.org/opinion-vijayanta-revisited/,"November 27, 2022","SOURCE: RYAN GEORGE KOYITHARA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Years after India’s independence, tensions with Pakistan reached a point where many border disputes were precipitated. India’s second war with its evil brother began in 1965 when Pakistan initiated Operation Gibraltar to smuggle troops into Jammu and Kashmir. At that point, Centurion MBTs made up the majority of the Indian Armoured army, and they operated reasonably well. However, there was already a desire in the 1950s to use domestic industrial resources to create an MBT that was exclusively Indian. It was planned to build an existing model under license even before the conflict of 1965, but at the same time with relatively lighter specifications in comparison to the Centurion. Vickers-Armstrong opted to build the Mark I, a 24-tonne, 20-pdr armed tank with a design heavily reliant on Centurion components, as a private undertaking. Later, the new and significantly more powerful L7 105 mm gun replaced this main weapon. Vickers Armstrong also agreed to construct a facility in India for this purpose because this development was timed to come to an agreement with India for a lighter tank design in 1961. With similar firepower to the Centurion, the final Vickers MBT Mk 1 was straightforward, affordable, and efficient. It was also sold to Kuwait (70). In India, the prototype was tested, and the production was approved. This model was given the name Vijayanta in India (“Victorious”). The Vijayanta was constructed in the same manner, using welded, rolled, homogenous armour plates, and weighed 38 short tonnes because the latter was mostly based on the Mark I with little alterations. It was somewhat comparable to the Soviet-made T-54/55 at the time, although this did not qualify it as a light tank. Compared to the Centurion, the armour was significantly less protective, with only 80 mm on the turret and glacis front plate. However, this was sufficient against traditional tanks from World War II or early Cold War variants like the Pakistani M47/M48 Pattons with a 90 mm cannon. The L7 additionally offered them the required “reach” to kill before even approaching range. Six roadwheels and three return rollers made up the drivetrain, but they weren’t arranged into three pairs of bogies; instead, they were evenly spaced apart and had individual torsion bars. In general, the drivetrain and profile were lower. Steel side skirts with seven panels were incorporated from the start. The turret was smaller in size and had the same design as the Centurion. It included a commander cupola with eight observation blocks made of bulletproof glass to the right and a straightforward two-piece hatch for the gunner to the left. Three storage boxes on the left and two on the right were placed to the sides, with an escape hatch in the middle. The L7, and later L7A2 main gun, with 44 rounds stored between the turret and the hull sides and floor, made up the armament. A coaxial 12.7 mm heavy machine gun with 2000 rounds of ammunition, an additional machine gun that could be mounted on the roof’s pintle, and a third 7.7 mm light machine gun that was also positioned coaxially to the main gun with 500 rounds of ammunition made up the secondary armament. The primary weapon could discharge HE, frag, and HEAT bullets. The methods for using the ranging gun were similar to those created in the UK with the Centurion and Chieftain, with the latter serving as a backup. The Vijayanta entered service after the war of 1965 had already begun, making it impossible to apply it to its full extent. However, via repeated drills, it met the general staff’s objectives for speed and mobility, and thanks to the Centurion’s experience, the same gunnery criteria were met. However, the Kashmir dispute led to their first battle test during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Indian Armoured divisions, which were primarily equipped with the Vijayanta at the time, intervened to support the Bangladesh independence movement and engaged in fierce combat until the Eastern Pakistani forces were forced to surrender. Due to the rugged terrain, the 1999 “Kargil War,” saw little tank action. It was followed by the demobilization of the older versions that were still in use. In the 1990s, it was planned that the whole Mk.1 fleet would be completely phased out of operation by 2008. The idea to upgrade and re-engineer the Vijayanta was approved in 1997, the same year that 296 “pre-Mark 1A” aircraft were already gradually decommissioned. Between 1999 and 2000, this revision was put on hold until its intended withdrawal in 2008. Production of spare components was already finished in 1989. However, due to issues with the Arjun MBT’s development, the entire fleet was replaced by the Ajeya (T-72M), which was produced under a license.

OPINION : LCA AF Mk2 /AMCA: Diminishing Timeline between two fighter programs should be a cause of concern,https://idrw.org/opinion-lca-af-mk2-amca-diminishing-timeline-between-two-fighter-programs-should-be-a-cause-of-concern/,"November 26, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG It’s more or less confirmed that the rollout of the LCA AF Mk2 has been postponed to the end of 2023 or at the worst case it will happen in March 2024 which means the first flight will be further pushed to late 2024 or early 2025 that is coming dangerously close to the AMCA program. AMCA’s timeline will see the first rollout in 2025 and the first flight in 2026 since the LCA AF Mk2 program was seen as the first step toward the realization of the AMCA program, little or no gap between both timelines suggests otherwise. When LCA AF Mk2 and AMCA program were announced many questioned the need for a 4.5th gen fighter, the rationale put forward was that the LCA AF Mk2 program will bridge the gap between LCA Mk1 and AMCA in terms of technology upgrades and also engineering capacity upgrades but a shift in the timeline means that it is unlikely LCA AF Mk2 will have any major effect on the AMCA program nor it will contribute into creation of the necessary expertise and infrastructure that were to expand after the conclusion of the LCA AF Mk1 program. Both Program requires nearly 25000 crores of funding and more manpower to execute these two programs that are now running parallel to each other instead of the LCA AF Mk2 program leading the race to be followed by the AMCA program. A country that is yet to expand its Aerospace ecosystem and its Private sector role in the country’s aerospace program should have merged both programs and instead should have worked on developing 4.5 gen and 5th gen based on a common platform like AMCA, an approach that Koreans have adopted for their KF-21 program. LCA AF Mk2 program had years of a head start yet it failed to take advantage of his head start and now might run parallel with the AMCA program. IAF wanted nearly 200 LCA AF Mk2 when it enter production but it is unclear if it will enter production before 2029-30 provided there is no further slippage in developmental trials this will further set this timeline away making the AMCA program closer to reality.

R-37M was designed to shoot down tankers, AWACS, and other C4ISTAR aircraft while allowing the launch platform to stay out of range of any fighter jets that are escorting them. 600kg missile has a 60kg warhead and has an operational range of 150 to 350km and uses its semi-active and active radar homing for guidance. Rudram-I has constant aerodynamic characteristics that are similar to Astra BVRAAM, Rudram-I also has added a range of over 200km that can be adapted as a Very long range air to air missile that will come in handy as a low-cost option to the Astra MkIII Varaint that it is under development. Rudram-I is based on the Dual-Pulse Motor is 600kg and had a 55kg warhead and is relatively cheaper to manufacture as per the latest order and definitely will cost less than Astra MkIII which will have a more expensive Ramjet propulsion."

With the activation of the production line after a long pause, idrw.org had been told Indian Army was approached by the DRDO to consider ordering more Arjun Mk-1A while it still works on the General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs) for the future main battle tank (FMBT). This request comes against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine where Russian Main Battle Tanks have not only underperformed but were proved to be quite vulnerable to the modern anti-armor weapons systems that were supplied by the western countries to Ukraine. The Arjun Production line has been activated after a gap of 10 years after DRDO completed the production of 124 Arjun Mk1 that were ordered in 2010. DRDO has proposed Indian Army to acquire 250 more units of Arjun Mk1A aircraft as FMBT will take time to develop and will become reality only after 2032 which will mean there will be another gap of 10 years before DRDO can commence production of another indigenous main battle tank. Arjun Mk1A has 72 new features and more indigenous features compared to the Mk-1 if the production line is active for more than 250 units it can be further upgraded with more advancements that are to be developed for the Light Tank program under Project Zoravar."

Both fighters have got their fair share of media publicity and the advantages of being a close supplier of the United States MIC (military-industrial complex) in the past and the ongoing F-35 program does have its advantages but that shouldn’t be used as an excuse by the ADA and HAL back home. Korean KF-21 still lacks Internal weapons back and stealth characters and can’t be considered a 5th gen platform as per admission made by its makers. While the TF-X program is the first Turkish attempt to make an indigenous fighter jet that will replace the bulk of its F-16 fleet it is still not considered an F-35 replacement after Turkey was kicked out of the program. Korean KF-21 program started receiving funds for the program from 2011 onwards and every year it has been receiving a portion of funds that were used to develop components and systems for the aircraft. KF-21 will evolve into 5th gen fighter aircraft only after 2030 onwards and in its present variant, it’s just a 4.5 gen fighter aircraft. Turkish attempts to develop TF-X also begin in 2010 onwards and the program has been getting funds through regular intervals. Turkish Aerospace Industries or TUSAS has not confirmed if TF-X will be a 5th gen aircraft from the start or if it will slowly evolve but internal documents do suggest that various upgraded blocks will be developed and that will enter production by 2040 suggesting that the aircraft will be upgraded over last few decades. India’s very own AMCA waits for final clearance from the government for funds that will start the program with the first flight planned sometime in 2026 if funds are allocated in early 2023. Unlike Turkish and Korean programs, India’s AMCA only got funds in 2017 which were mear 231 crores which were considered as seed money to kick start the development of some of the niche technologies for the program but not the full engineering program. AMCA crossed its first milestone when it submitted Preliminary Design Review (PDR) report in 2020 to the IAF. Next month ADA will be submitting its Critical Design Review (CDR) to IAF which will clear its path to CCS clearance for the program. Current assembly activity is limited to the fabrication of AMCA ‘Test Box’ at HAL’s ARDC facilities in Bengaluru which will be followed by the Ground test specimen. HAL and ADA are already manufacturing some of the components that will be used for internal testing before it is incorporated into the prototype. CCS clearance at the earliest is key to the rollout of the prototype and first flight. if CCS Clearance happens by April 2023 and rollout and the first flight is quite possible by 2025-26 which is the same deadline that both KF-21 and TF-X programs have to launch fully build fighter jets as per 5th gen specifications."

High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability or HAAWC is a Mk 54 lightweight anti-submarine torpedo transformed into a long-range, quickly-delivered standoff weapon. HAAWC kits when equipped with Mk 54 lightweight anti-submarine torpedo will give its a 32km range before the HAAWC kit is ejected over the sea while a parachute is used to softly touch down the torpedo which can go for another 9-10km before taking out its target. The HAAWC kit also includes a data link that allows the complete weapon to be retargeted in flight and also it can be realized from higher cruising altitudes like 33,000 feet without the need for aircraft to go low which reduces any potential vulnerability to any enemy air defenses in the area. When the Indian fleet of P-8I is cleared to employ HAAWC-equipped Mk 54 torpedoes it will offer a significant boost in its anti-submarine warfare capabilities and its overall survivability.

Kapoor also defended user trials that can go on for several years as the Indian Army wants until it is satisfied but often these user trials have been in controversy specifically stringent requirements that are set only for Indigenous weapons systems while Imported weapons get cleared after one-fourth of time when compared to the time taken to clear Indigenous weapons. A famous and controversial case was when Indigenous Arjun Main Battle Tank was under testing that went on for nearly 30-plus years. For many years Arjun did have many issues but in later years it demonstrated quite a capability but Army had changed its mind and wanted a medium-weight tank and not a heavy tank anymore in reaction to Pakistan failing to get Abrams Heavy Main Battle Tanks from the United States. Arjun Trials were controversial because Army at one point in time had been accused of a vested interest in sabotaging the tank at trial so that it underperformed and DRDO had to get Israeli tank experts to test the tank in one-to-one mode with Army’s T-90. Results demolished T-90s and Arjun came out the victor but that never translated into orders. Kapoor in his tenure never really backed Indignieus weapons at large and Army User trials have become a meme after Manohar Parrikar then Defence minister had called Army requirements directly out of Marvel Comic books. Army in past has been accused of stitching up requirements based on multiple brochures that often make even International weapons manufacturers cry in pain. Way Army user trials go on for years while the same standards are not followed for the foreign weapons systems, Modi’s Dream of taking India into top Weapons manufacturing country and Exporter will remain a pipe dream until the Army biggest of the three forces starts accepting locally made weapons systems but it simply can’t have multiple user trials without cost or time being specified. Till now Army has failed to streamline its weapons procurement procedure and also has failed to limit rounds of user trials. Modi should plan to have Independent Weapons Testing Agency that will be in charge of user trials and also sets user requirements in coordination with Indian Military branches and only keeps small officers from the Indian military as independent observers when trials are held.

Argentina’s search for fighter jets might have come down to just two which are left in the race that is Indian Tejas and the Chinese JF-17 which will include the off-the-shelf purchase of 12 jets directly from the vendor and local production rights that will allow its state-owned Aerospace company Fabrica Militar de Aviones (FMA). idrw.org has been told that Argentina has told both vendors that it plans to locally manufacture jets likely in a semi-knocked-down kit (SKD) with Argentinian equipment that may see the procurement of further 30 jets in long run. Chinese have offered Sanction proof JF-17 that will come with locally produced ejection seats and a WS-13 engine which is copied variant of the Russian RD-93 engine that is used on the Pakistani, Myanmar, and Nigerian versions. India has offered to replace all British Components with local or other imported substitutes but HAL has been told that India will need to bare the cost of such substitute components and their integration as Argentina won’t be doing it. Argentina has raised concern regarding the WS-13 engine on offer since even its close friend Pakistan preferred Russian RD-93 engines over it and on Tejas they are worried that it might cost more since it still has many British components. The only Advantage Tejas is having over JF-17 is that Argentinian Air Force officials prefer Israeli A2A weapons like Python-5 and Derby due to prior experience with Israeli A2A systems over Chinese PL-12 and PL-10 is considered inferior to Israeli A2A weapons systems. Argentina had confirmed that it has deferred its decision due to the first study pending evaluation reports of the LCA-Tejas that was done last month and the Danish F-16 that was done earlier this month. Final Decisions might be announced sometime in 2023."

Therefore, of course, we are taking necessary measures and cannot allow Armenia to create danger for us, we can never allow that to happen. Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev also said that he said this to Armenian side several times not to waste money on that (weapons). Because, first of all, it will not help you (Armenia), and secondly, it may create an illusion that you can retaliate. You (Armenia) will not be able to! if we see that there is a serious threat to us, we will crush this threat immediately, no matter where this threat comes from , from our territory’s or beyond our borders. Armenia has recently purchased weapons from India in order to strengthen its defences after being overwhelmed by Turkish and Israeli weapons supplies, which allowed Azerbaijan to seize control of some areas of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. After the war, Armenia began with Swathi Weapon Locating Radar (WLR) and also placed orders for Pinaka multi barrel rocket launcher, Multi-terrain Artillery Gun (MArG) 155 – BR 155mm 39 calibre gun, and has plans to procure more weapons from India, including loitering ammunitions, tank rounds, equipping Su-30 with Indian weapons such as Astra and BrahMos, and Air Defence systems. Azerbaijan Defense Analysts initially mocked Armenia’s purchase of Indian weapons, calling them unreliable and untested, but Armenia found Indian-made Swath and Pinaka to be far superior to what other countries had to offer because both systems were already inducted and tested in the Indian Armed Forces. Azerbaijan remains on Pakistan’s side in the Kashmir conflict, calling for international law to be followed in order to find a solution. Foreign ministers from Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Pakistan met in Islamabad in January 2021 to issue a joint declaration on a variety of issues. The parties also expressed concern about “human rights violations in and efforts to change the demographic structure of Jammu and Kashmir” in the document, and they reiterated their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict “in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”"

OPINION : China JL-3 SLBM and Why India needs to fast track its SLBM Program,https://idrw.org/opinion-china-jl-3-slbm-and-why-india-needs-to-fast-track-its-slbm-program/,"November 22, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG US intelligence report indicates that China has started to put its longer-range JL-3, a third-generation intercontinental-range submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) into PLA Navy’s six Jin-class submarines, replacing the older Chinese second-generation JL-2 SLBM. JL-3 enjoys a superior range of over 3000km which puts its range around the 10000km mark that has raised several eyebrows in the US Navy circle but it should equally concern India for various reasons. Despite its impressive long range, the JL-3 cannot hit anywhere in the United States but it can hit targets all over India without even entering Indian Ocean Region (IOR). China already has a credible land-based missile that can hit various targets in India but JL-3 enforces China’s nuclear triad that India still has achieved partially with its SLBMs. India’s longest SBLM till now has been the K-4 which had a range of 3500-4000km which makes it more Pakistan-centric since it allows Indian submarines to hide deep in the Indian ocean away from its coastline ensuring India’s nuclear triad remains intact but the same can’t be said for China since the range of the K-4 won’t be enough. India has been working steadily towards that realization and is working on K5 and K6 which will have a range of 5000-8000km but it needs SLBM with more range so that the Chinese navy that will be deployed in IOR to hunt for Indian submarines that will require to operate farther way from its coastline. India should strive to achieve SLBMS that can be over more than 10000km so that the Chinese are well aware of India’s credible nuclear triad that is in place to remove nuclear options away from China in case of full-fledged war or border dispute between both countries in future.

Bayraktar TB2 was instrumental in hitting the Armenian positions and causing significant damage to the Armenian military. Armed Drones always have been hogging limelight after American Predator drones started taking out strategic targets in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Pakistan but a price tag of nearly close to $100 million meant that not many could afford it, then came reports of the major success of the Bayraktar that became an instant hit in the export market, especially with countries that are having smaller airforce’s and with the advent of low cost $3-5 million per unit, Bayraktar became an instant success thanks largely due to hyper PR activities carried out by its manufactures. At the start of the Ukraine war, Russian Air Defence was scrambling to put together proper tactics to take on threats it was facing from the Bayraktar TB2 drones and in a matter of few weeks, TB2 started proving to its detractors why it was just hype as most of them were lost in once Russia put its act together and started taking them out. Ukrainian sources confirm that the Bayraktar survival rate had fallen to just 7 days once they start flying in combat operations and instead it was decided to conserve them to reduce their roles in attack missions and keep them concentrated on reconnaissance roles or for providing data for pinpoint artillery fire. Bayraktar became increasingly ineffective because Russia has improved its defense systems and has downed and jammed many over the last few months. Russians are using warning radars to identify the drones and electronic warfare systems to jam and Air Defence systems to destroy them. Bayraktar is slow-moving and also flies low due to which its interception has become much easier. Indian Military Planners never showed much enthusiasm to arm UAVs for use in conflict even when Bayraktar’s success was hogging all the limelight. Indian Military Planners were sure that the MALE Class Armed UAS system has little chance of survival in highly dense combat operations when it is backed by Air Defence Systems. Ukraine war just proved them right but they did take considerable interest in upping the intake of loitering ammunition after studying their usage in the Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict. Indian military always had Israeli loitering ammunition in its arsenal but it encouraged Indian private sector companies to develop ones locally and has achieved great success with over a dozen companies developing loitering ammunition for the Indian military in a short period with many inducted and many ordered, Indian military planners have bet on loitering ammunition over Armed Drones for future battlefield operations and the recent success of Iranian loitering ammunition in Ukraine just proved them right."

HLFT-42 will be a metal aircraft that will be easy to manufacture and will have low input cost for it to be used as a fighter that is even lower than Tejas Mk1 which was just over $40 million per unit. HAL Management seems to have realized early that there is a market of ultra-low-cost fighter trainer aircraft that needs to be priced below $15 million per unit cost to make it saleable to countries that are still interested in aircraft to replace old legacy fighters like the J-7/F-7 and Mig-21. HLFT-42 will attract three main classes of potential customers, one that wants a small jet capable of carrying out a variety of strike and intelligence-gathering missions, and who has never flown a combat jet before or is looking to replace older vintage aircraft. Second, countries that can afford high-end fighter jets but want ultra-low-cost trainer aircraft that can be used to train their future fighter pilots which will have no or minimal usage in actual combat. Third, countries that have very low-risk environments to work in won’t mind procuring jets like the HLFT-42 class of jets that can be used on simpler missions over combat zones with no air defense system.

Cheng said that this has prevented all Tender bidders from Fair, Transparent, and Professional Evaluation and Comparisons of their Tender bid systems. These unscrupulous decisions and collaborated actions amount to an abuse of power and are indications of corrupt practices. These treacherous actions, if not prevented may result in the nation being denied the choice of the best performing, most value for money, cost-effective, and long-term viable systems for future credible defense.

Bharat-52 which costs around 13-14cr per unit will see the supply of 70-80 guns to the former operator of the GC-45 howitzer. Saudi Arabia’s Military carried out trials in 2020 and was impressed with the major improvements that were done on the baseline GC-45 howitzer that Saudi Military is familiar with as it still operates them. idrw.org can confirm that Kalyani is also in talks with some African countries that have shown interest in the gun and soon talks and trials of the gun might be carried out. Bharat 52 orders coming from the export market will certainly boost its chances in the International arena since it is a relatively cheaper option and also comes with new-age technologies to improve its accuracy on the battlefield. Kalyani is presently expanding its manufacturing facility and plans to manufacture one gun a day in the next 3 years which will include 4-5 different types of howitzer that the company has developed for the Indian military and exports."

HLFT-42 Will be Low-Cost All-Metal Aircraft,https://idrw.org/hlft-42-will-be-low-cost-all-metal-aircraft/,"November 7, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Defense PSUs Hindustan Aeronautic Limited (HAL) in its Annual Report 2021-22 confirmed that under the company’s new initiatives it has started the development of the Hindustan Lead in fighter Trainer (HLFT-42) program. HLFT-42 being a LIFT aircraft it was assumed that it will be based on the Baseline LCA-Tejas Trainer since HAL earlier had shown the LCA Trainer in the LIFT Concept. Jayadeva E.P, Director (Operations) at HAL at the Investor meeting said that HLFT-42 will be a low-cost alternative to the LCA-Tejas Trainer which will be all metal and will not have a Digital fly by wire (FBW) system, instead, it will have a power-assisted flight controls system (FCS). LCA-LIFT and HLFT-42 both are being offered by HAL to IAF to be used as Lead In fighter Trainers that can be used to train newbie fighter pilots before they fly the fighter type they will be deputed to after joining their squadrons. Both LCA-LIFT and HLFT-42 aircraft will be able to simulate aircraft handlings, speeds, and performance that give similar feedback as the aircraft they will eventually fly to get prior experience before they fly them. Jayadeva confirmed that HLFT-42 will have high indigenous content except for maybe engines, it will have all Indian-made systems and subsystems and will be a highly cost-effective training solution. It’s still not clear whether HLFT-42 will be a new design or still will be based on LCA-Tejas Trainer minus Composites and Digital Fly by Wire (FBW) but since LCA has a double delta wing configuration that makes it is an inherently unstable aircraft. But much before the Digital FBW system arrived there did exist delta wings fighter jets like Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, and Saab 35 Draken that had all mechanical power-assisted flight controls system. Defense Expert Ranesh Rajan told idrw.org that HLFT-42 without a Digital FBW system will be seen as a major weakness of the platform since all LIFT aircraft in the segment like American T-7A Red Hawk or Chinese Hongdu JL-10 incorporate Digital Fly by Wire (FBW) system. Rajan feels that HAL likely will incorporate Digital Fly by Wire (FBW) system once detailed studies on the program start since even the HJT-36 Sirata Intermediate Jet Trainer has Digital Fly by Wire system."

OPINION : AD-1 and its Spin-off will enhance the Indian Air Defence system,https://idrw.org/opinion-ad-1-and-its-spin-off-will-enhance-the-indian-air-defence-system/,"November 4, 2022","SOURCE: TUSHKAR SHIRODKAR / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. India tested the first missile of its Phase-II Ballistic Missile Defence shield. Interceptor called AD-1 is a cornerstone system that will help in the development of India’s Next generation air defense component that is under development under its Extended Range Air Defence System (ERADS) Program. DRDO plans to develop two new Air Defence Interceptor missiles with a long and very long-range interceptor missiles called ERSAM and XRSAM that will be on par with the S-400 Air defense system that has been recently acquired by the Indian Air Force. ERSAM which is based on the Indo-Israeli LR-SAM/MR-SAM will have a range of 150-200km and will form the lower-end interceptor missile off the ERADS. XRSAM will use an AD-1 Airframe and some of its components will be India’s long-range Interceptor missile that can take out Force multipliers at a range of 350-450km and Fighter-sized targets at 250km. AD-1 already can intercept Force multipliers like AWACS and Air Tankers that are flying well within its airspace but it can’t take out highly maneuvering fighter jets this is why a spin-off program will see the development of an XRSAM Interceptor missile that will be more optimized for taking out such targets while AD-1 is optimized for the ability to intercept a unitary target in the low endo-atmosphere. ERADS will also make its way into the shipborne version as the Navy plans to replace its Indo-Israeli LR-SAM with longer-range ERSAM and XRSAM in future warships that are to be manufactured. Russian S-300 and S-400 have demonstrated by taking out fighter jets at a distance of 150km and 217km that such long-range surface-to-air kill is very much possible if it is backed by an entire eco-system of surveillance and track and search radars that have extremely long-range capabilities. ERADS will enhance India’s overwhelming superiority in air defense in the coming years and also aid in the defense of the Ballistic Missile Defence shield.

OPINION : The Untold Story of INS Rajali: India’s 80 Year Old Naval Air Station,https://idrw.org/opinion-the-untold-story-of-ins-rajali-indias-80-year-old-naval-air-station/,"November 4, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. The INS Rajali, which is also known informally as the Arakkonam Naval Air Station (IATA: N/A, ICAO: VOAR), is near Arakkonam in the Ranipet District of Tamil Nadu in South India. It is run by the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy, located in Vishakhapatnam. It has the longest military airstrip in Asia. During World War II, the Allies built the airfield at Arakkonam at the beginning of 1942. Between May and September 1942, the No. 2 Squadron of the Royal Indian Air Force flew support missions for the British Indian Army in Westland Lysander planes. This was the first time that air operations were recorded at the field. After the war, the airfield was left empty, and it wasn’t used again until the 1980s, when the Indian Navy took it over. They fixed it up and named it INS Rajali. On March 11, 1992, the INS Rajali went into service. Captain RS Vasan was in charge, and he later retired as a commodore after being sent to the Coast Guard to be the regional commander of the Coast Guard East Region. Anti-submarine squadron INAS 312 is based at the newly built air base. It was shifted from INS Hansa in Goa. On April 16, 1988, Sri K. C. Pant, who was Minister of Defense at the time, handed over the Tupolev Tu-142 MK-E to the squadron. Albatross, which is what they are called, celebrated their 25th anniversary of becoming a member at Rajali. They have been retired now. The P8i Poseidon has now taken over from the TU 142 M. The Helicopter Training School used to be on the INS Garuda in Kochi. In July 1991, the school moved to Rajali, where it has been training Navy and Coast Guard helicopter pilots ever since. The INS Rajali has a runway that is 9.4 km long and covers an area of 2320 square metres. Creation of INS Rajali This history is recorded in the account of Vice Admiral Vinod Pasricha on Frontier India. During his trip to Chennai at the end of 1983, Flag-Officer -in ‘Chief , Eastern Naval Command (FOC-in-C ENA)VAdm Roy took a helicopter to Arakkonam. He saw a strip that was completely empty and had no walls around it. Villagers were walking across the runways to get to Arkonam city faster. When VAdm MK Roy got back to Vizag, he told a group of officers to start building a TU-142 airbase right away. Arakkonam was split into six areas: a) operational areas, which had hangars, distribution points, workshops, air stores, and plenty of room to grow. b) The centre has all the offices, the ATC, and the hospital. c) Officers’ mess and lodging, with an institute and a golf course just a short walk away. d) Multi-storied flats for 1500 sailors, parks and gardens. (Even though the approved number of people was only 580, PMB approved housing for the approved number of people. So, sailors could choose which house or floor they wanted for the first time in IN history!) e) Rooms for sailors who live on board and DSC staff. f) Schools, canteens, a movie theatre, and other places to have fun were built in the middle of all residential areas. The INS Rajali project was completed in a record three years and commissioned on March 11 1992, by President R Venkataraman. On “Committing Day,” the runway wasn’t completely ready because the contractor left without finishing his work. Then, Border Roads Organisation (BRO) took over and finished it in four months. Even though TU-142s were supposed to start flying as soon as INS Rajali was put into service, they couldn’t do so until the main runway was finished. However, the first official landing was done on Commissioning day after some practice. Before the Monsoons, The helicopter Training School moved from Kochi to Arakkonam. It was housed in the maintenance hangar until its own hangar was ready. So, the training course was done earlier than scheduled. Rajali is one of the few defence projects that was not only finished on time but also did not cost more than what was approved. INS Rajali as a reconnance base On November 8, 1976, the Indian Navy’s First Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron went into service with five Super Constellations that had been used by the Indian Air Force. Squadron Leader R. D. Dhir was in charge of the group. At first, the squadron was based at INS Hansa in Goa. The Super Constellation was no longer made after 1983. The Tupolev 142M was given to the squadron on April 16, 1988, by Defense Minister KC Pant. Since then, the Albatross has led the Indian Navy’s maritime reconnaissance (MR) efforts because it was so good at it. It was also the fastest turboprop in the world. Albatross remained the aircraft of choice in the Indian Navy for long-range reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, and ESM/EW until P-8I arrived. This is because the equipment is constantly updated, and new technologies were added. The squadron moved to INS Rajali in Arakkonam in April 1992 and has been there ever since. On March 7, 1992, the first TU142M arrived at Rajali. On November 13, 2016, Indian Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar officially inducted a Boeing P-8I Poseidon aircraft, designated 312-A, at INS Rajali. The new unit with P-8I will reside at INS Rajali for good. The P-8 is a maritime patrol plane that can do many different things well. It is especially good at anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and search and rescue. At a ceremony on March 29, 2017, at INS Rajali, Admiral Sunil Lanba took the Tupolev Tu-142M planes out of service for the Indian Navy. The Tupolev Tu-142M was used in Operation Cactus in the Maldives, Operation Vijay in 1998, Operation Parakram in 2002, and anti-piracy operations from 2011 until it was taken out of service. Two P-8I planes were stationed at a military base in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands for two weeks in January 2016. This was done because Chinese conventional and nuclear submarines had been infiltrating in the Indian Ocean over and over again. From March 20–23, 2016, a P-8I went to Seychelles to keep an eye on the EEZ of Seychelles. It was the first time that a P8I plane was sent to Seychelles. On April 15, 2016, about 800 nautical miles from Mumbai, a pirate attack on the high seas was stopped by a P-8I flying over a merchant ship that was being attacked by a pirate mother ship and two boats. The MV Sezai Selah, a merchant ship with a flag from Malta, sent out a distress call on Channel 16’s international distress radio. The P-8I was already in the Arabian Sea on a planned surveillance mission when it heard the call. The mother ship of the pirates and two speedboats came close to the merchant ship. The P-8I took action right away and sent out warning signals on channel 16 as it flew over the pirate boats. The pirate boats were scared and changed course. In 2020 and 2021, when the standoff with China was at its peak, P-8Is were used in eastern Ladakh to keep an eye on Chinese troops. On February 24, 2022, Boeing delivered India its 12th P-8I maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare plane. The Navy’s fleet has flown more than 29,000 hours since they were put into service in 2013. They are responsible for patrolling the coast, searching for and saving people, stopping pirates, and helping other parts of the military do their jobs. INS Rajali will remain the most important surveillance facility in the Indian Ocean for India.

OPINION : Ejection Seats – Even the best fighter jets in the world could fail.?,https://idrw.org/opinion-ejection-seats-even-the-best-fighter-jets-in-the-world-could-fail/,"November 3, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. A mechanical problem caused a MiG-29K fighter aircraft from the Indian Navy to crash off the coast of Goa on October 12, 2022, during a normal mission. The pilot ejected safely and landed in the water, according to the Navy. While the pilot successfully ejected, he landed in the Arabian Sea near Goa and required rapid rescue. This is the latest incident where an ejection seat helped save a pilot’s life. The ejection seat is hard, as if the seat cushion is squeezed unevenly due to the strong G forces encountered during ejection. The pilot’s spine will not be in the “proper position” before ejection. And a curved spine would certainly result in injury. It includes a “survival kit” packaged in a box that must survive the collision with the ground. The survival kit includes numerous goods essential for immediate survival, such as a first aid kit, a morphine injection as a painkiller, certain high-energy compact foods, fishing baits, a knife, and occasionally an emergency radio. With the use of Ejection Seats, pilots may safely evacuate a fighter jet and avert certain death if they are unable to save their aircraft. Here is how they operate. In the jet era of high speeds, the problem of leaving the aircraft became more difficult – in particular, the risks of colliding with airframe elements when leaving the aircraft increased. Pilots who declare “May Day” are immediately hoisted from their crashing aircraft. Once the danger has passed, ejection seats automatically release a parachute to enable pilots to descend safely. The whole procedure takes just a few seconds. The catapult, rocket, restraints, and parachute are the primary components of the ejection seat, and they must all activate in a certain order and almost simultaneously. If even one step goes badly, a pilot attempting to escape might be in serious jeopardy. Once a crew member activates the ejection procedure via a handle or other device, they will be out of the aircraft in less than one second. Pulling on the ejection handles sends an electrical pulse that signals thrusters to blow the canopy. Or, open the hatch, spin it up and out into the airflow, or blast it out of the aircraft. Almost simultaneously, an explosive cartridge is detonated in the seat catapult cannon with the assistance of an under-seat rocket motor. To protect their legs from debris, a leg restraint mechanism is activated. Sensors assess the aircraft’s speed and air pressure to decide when the parachute should be deployed. For aircraft flying at high speeds and altitudes, the primary parachute’s deployment is delayed so that the pilot may reach denser air as rapidly as feasible. Instead, a smaller chute known as a drogue is deployed to decrease the pace of the fall and stabilise the motion so that the pilot is not thrown into a fatal spin. The primary parachute will deploy more rapidly at lower speeds and altitudes. A seat separator motor fires after the parachute is opened, causing the seat to fall to its death while the pilot is safely lifted during a typical parachute landing. Ejection from an aeroplane is a violent series of events that exposes the body to significant amounts of force. Therefore, engineers must counteract at least part of the G-forces. Pilots must experience a catapult-like ejection, which must occur at the optimal speed. If it occurs too rapidly, pilots run the danger of suffering a serious spinal injury. When a pilot presses the eject lever, there is a one-in-three possibility that they may shatter their spine, and 20 to 30 per cent of those who survive the ejection procedure report some sort of spinal damage. In response to this reoccurring problem, zero-zero ejection seats were developed. They are so named because they permit extraction at zero altitudes and zero wind speeds. Earlier Ejection seat designs could only operate successfully over a minimum altitude and velocity threshold. New designs for ejection seats permit extraction at lower altitudes and speeds, hence decreasing the danger of spinal damage during ejections. When pilots lose control of their damaged aircraft, ejection seats are always the final option. Flying a jet is inherently perilous. Thus pilots need additional safety precautions, such as ejection seats, for when the worst happens. Martin-Baker of the United Kingdom is the global leader in the design of ejection seats. Indian aircraft, except the Russian ones, use these seats. However, there are situations where India might not like to use them in the domestic made aircraft, like in the case of exports to Argentina, which faces sanctions by the British. India is actively scouting for ejection seats from other sources, including the Russian ones. LCA Tejas might now also have an option of being fitted with a Russian Zvezda K-36DM “zero-zero” ejection seat or Collins Aerospace’s legacy ACES II ejection seat. The F 35 is equipped with a Martin-Baker MK16-US16E ejection seat. It is one of the most advanced MB seats providing safe ejection even at ground level. The US16E is the only Qualified Ejection Seat that meets the US Government defined Neck Injury Criteria (NIC) across the pilot accommodation range. In the event of the pilot pulling the handle, there is a great likelihood of him/her surviving in a F 35. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has purchased Mk.16 Ejection Seats for its HTT40 trainer aircraft, adding 212 Martin-Baker Seats to the existing 1,013 Seats in service with the IAF and Indian Navy. Additionally, the IAF has recently placed orders for additional Tejas aircraft for Martin-Baker Mk. 16 ejection Seats. It has been learnt that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has been in talks with Martin Baker for transfer of technology. However, the terms of the transfer of technology are creating friction. Through open sources HAL is keen on manufacturing ejection seats in India. Martin Baker has ceded to a select few transfer of technology which HAL believes are against the spirit of transfer of technology. HAL might not be able to sufficiently build indigenous ejection seats with such a limited and narrow transfer of technology.

OPINION : Why India is still reluctant to work on an indigenous narrow-body airliner?,https://idrw.org/opinion-why-india-is-still-reluctant-to-work-on-an-indigenous-narrow-body-airliner/,"November 2, 2022","SOURCE: RAJESH AHUJA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Boeing-Airbus both have made similar Sales Projections that India in the next 10-15 years will be requiring close to 2000 aircraft to meet the demands of its booming aviation sector but non of these companies have shown plans to locally manufacture any of their aircraft from their wide range of portfolio in India thus limiting India’s position as just client rather than as a partner in their business projections. According to Aviation experts, a majority share of aircraft needed by India will be Regional jets and Narrow-body aircraft which will attribute close to 85% of the aircraft that have been projected by Boeing-Airbus. Wide-body aircraft that are usually reserved for long-haul routes in International sectors will see limited requirements. Regional jets that are often powered by Turboprop or Turbojet jet engines are ideal for short-haul flights within a radius of 600-800km to carry 70-90 pax at their max capacities. Narrow-body aircraft that are powered by Turbojet jet engines are ideal for short-medium haul flights often used on busy sectors since they can carry more then 120+ passengers. This segment is presently dominated by A320/321 variants and Boeing 757 and larger 737 variants in India. CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories had proposed developing a Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) aircraft with a pax capacity of 70-90 for short-medium haul flights within the country but that could have required massive investment coming from the Government. CSIR-NAL has little or no experience working on a such major project in the country and after the sale of Air India to Tata Group, the Governments interest in the program dipped considerably since it is no more running an airline company and unlike China it cant force Private Airline companies to procure locally developed aircraft for their operations. CSIR-NAL’s plans to develop RTA for the Indian market made logical sense since it could have promoted jobs and the aviation sector in the country but it failed to understand that the airline sector doesn’t bet on new players, certainly not on a company that has no great product to display nor any past achievements. RTA-90 will remain a non-starter unless it joins hands with some reputed foreign OEM company and also allows Private sector companies to be part of its supply chain. CSIR-NAL needs to seek funding from private sector investors and institutions for this project to become viable and to also fix accountability that will generate a level of confidence in airline players in the country.

One of the most intricate systems on board an aircraft is the engine. It has components with extremely high rotations per minute (RPM), which must perform flawlessly from sea level to near the stratosphere and from zero to high supersonic speeds. In India, the civilian aircraft engine is a big market, but the entire discussion is focused on military engines. The state corporation Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is India’s biggest talking point in the military engine market. While everybody is focusing on the Indian market for the HAL engines, TATA Group is also preparing a Joint Venture with GE for aero engine components. They are already making the engine gauging. They are planning to make blades, pallets, etc. Tata is trying to develop the market for the LEAP 1A engine. Tata is already doing LEAP 1V for Airbus, LEAP 1A for Boeing and LEAP 1C for Comet C919 in China. GE plans to supply engines for 1,170 regional jets, 14,620 single aisles, 3,300 vast bodies and 485 freighters. The lion’s share will be single-aisle, accounting for 75% of the planned production, while 17% of the total will be a wide body. The total production will be around 20,000. In the coming years, the demand for freighters is going to increase by over 80%. According to Boeing, there will be 47,080 planes in the air by 2040. Many Indian companies are interested in aerospace, such as Tata, Mahindra, Bharat Forge and Triveni. The supersonic company Boom already has 60 supersonic jet orders, of which 40 are from American United Airlines and 20 from Japanese Airlines. Their first flight will be inducted in 2029, yet they have already booked the planes. Each plane requires four engines. Boom is working with GE to finalise the new engines. The Defence engines In the first week of July, Safran Group CEO Olivier Andries met defence minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi to discuss his company’s long-term ambition of jointly developing and producing revolutionary jet engines. Safran, a global OEM of military and commercial aircraft engines, makes Rafale engines. Snecma M88 engines in Indian Rafales have a maximum thrust of 75kN. (kilonewtons). The Navy needs 30 carrier-based fighter jets while the IAF wants 114 multi-role fighters. Value? $20 billion. Assuming a spare ratio of 1.5 engines/installed engine, the IAF needs around 2,300 engines for 600 India-made fighters. In the future, the 282 Sukhoi planes will undergo engine refurbishment. All these engines will cost India a lot of foreign exchange. Global aerospace companies are rushing jet engine technology to India for this massive business opportunity. US-France competition is sharpest. Foreign companies will sell or indigenize their products for India, but only with huge orders. Only the US, France, the UK, and Russia have mastered combat aircraft engine production technologies. Due to the lack of thrust in its expensive WS-10 engines, China uses Russian engines for its J-20 aircraft. Nine Kaveri engine prototypes have failed to power an aircraft since 1986. In 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported that the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s (DRDO) Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) has been unable to deliver the Kaveri engine that could power the LCA despite a cost overrun of 642 per cent and a delay of about 13 years”. The LCA Tejas and its successors, the Tejas Mk2 and AMCA, will use GE F414 engines. IAF needs 170 Tejas Mk2, six squadrons. It also inducted seven AMCA squadrons. GE, HAL, and other private companies will build F414 engines in India. The business will transfer manufacturing technology and production engines if the US government approves. The Super Hornet has two GE F414-400 afterburning turbofan engines while the Rafale-M will use Safran’s M88 engine. However, India’s military planners believe that since the government has been considering planes for 20 years, it must decide on engine manufacturing immediately. The Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) chose GE F404 engines (90kN) for the Tejas, lowering its payload and range. A top IAF officer who worked in the LCA’s development team claims the GE F414 engine with 95-98kN power thrust planned for Tejas Mk2 is suboptimal for the IAF’s medium-weight fighter class of 15-18 tonnes, which requires a 5-tonne combat payload and 600 kilometres on internal fuel. The AMCA Mk2, developed by the ADA, needs 110 kN thrust, which is not yet available worldwide, to meet supercruise criteria. Production is expected in 2035. The IAF’s 16 fighter squadrons—three Mirage 2000, five MiG-29, six Jaguar strike aircraft, and two MiG-21 Bison—will be replaced with the LCA Mk2. By 2040, IAF expects 40 squadrons. After Kaveri failed, LCA builders had to use foreign engines. GTRE sought an international engine-house to co-develop a 90kN engine in 2005. The scheme failed. France proposed complete transfer of technology (ToT) in 2012 to modify and fix the Kaveri engine for the LCA Tejas. The agreement failed due to its excessive price. The US has renewed its proposal for jet engine technology collaboration under the India-US Defence Trade and Technology Initiative, which was stopped in October 2019 due to American unwillingness to share technology. Tata makes civilian jet engine parts with GE. Safran and HAL also collaborated on the helicopter Shakti engine. Safran proposed an engine technology transfer as part of the offset clause days after the Rafale purchase in 2015, but it failed. Rolls-Royce, partnered with HAL, wants to co-develop a 110 kN AMCA engine. Safran’s ToT costs close to $5 billion. It will give engine manufacturing know-how and certification. Former Safran Aircraft Engines vice president Satish Kirtikar says India can only gain independence in aircraft engine technology by buying “knowhow and know-why” from a foreign OEM. ToT will be expensive. Military planners must choose between AatmaNirbhar and reliance. Its ambitions will soar then.

OPINION : TEDBF could be an ideal Tactical Fighter bomber for India’s Nuclear Command or IAF,https://idrw.org/opinion-tedbf-could-be-an-ideal-tactical-fighter-bomber-for-indias-nuclear-command-or-iaf/,"October 31, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG The era of fighter bombers will end when the Indian Air Force retires its Jaguar fighter fleet from its service in 2035. Mirage-2000 has been the Choice of aircraft that will play the role of delivering nukes if that day ever comes but the fleet won’t be their long enough and might be completely gone by 2035 onwards. In 2010, The Strategic Forces Command (SFC) submitted a proposal to the Defence Ministry for setting up two dedicated squadrons of fighter aircraft which will act as Mini-Air Force. SFC back then was looking for an aircraft that has endurance and range to carry out long-run missions and that can stay in the air waiting for final command in case of war is heading towards a nuclear end. SFC seemed interested in Su-30MKI due to its long-range mission capabilities but the command was also worried about its huge radar cross section and its inability to remain low-key in hostile airspace, which won’t make it a great Tactical Fighter bomber for nuke-delivering missions. TEDBF is a 26.5-tonne monster of an aircraft that will be India’s biggest fighter jet that will be developed to meet the requirements of the Indian Navy for its air operations from the aircraft carrier. TEDBF inherits the design of a low observable frontal section and also can stay longer in the air, being a naval aircraft it is also designed to fly low over oceans or at tree-top levels to avoid being detected and also will have excellent low-speed maneuvering characteristics that are essentials for its operations from the small decks of the aircraft carrier that can also be a great advantage for operations from small airfields. TEDBF in a modified form can be made to accommodate Air-Launched Nuclear Tipped Ballistic missiles or Guided weapons to be used as fighter bombers in non-nuclear roles under the supervision of the IAF. IAF sure will induct Tejas Mark 2 and AMCA in large numbers to be used as Omni-Role /Multi-Role fighter jets that will be used for fighter battles over contested airspace and also to take out ground-based targets. but TEDBF due to its high Weapons load capabilities and even higher MTOW capabilities does bring some advantages over them so that it can be utilized as a Nuclear Carrier or as Tactical Fighter Bomber that steps in for the Jaguar Bomber fleet once retired.

OPINION : Unlocking the Lithium Economy: Argentina May Look to HAL LCH Prachand for Lithium Mining,https://idrw.org/opinion-unlocking-the-lithium-economy-argentina-may-look-to-hal-lch-prachand-for-lithium-mining/,"October 28, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. Argentina, the eighth largest country in the world, together with Chile and Bolivia, forms the Lithium Triangle. The Lithium Triangle accounts for more than 70 per cent of global lithium reserves. However, Argentine mining operations have been less than stellar, currently providing barely 15 per cent of the global output. The Argentine government is bullish on lithium mining as the market is expected to double by 2028 to USD 7 billion. And Hindustan Aeronautics Limited’s (HAL) Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) Prachand can enable their Lithium dream. Abundant White Gold Abandoned Lithium, the Argentine white gold, is distributed across Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, roughly 25 per cent, 15 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. However, in 2021, Chile exported USD 1 billion worth of Lithium, while Argentina could only export USD 200 million. Lithium alone has the potential to form over 3 per cent of the Argentine GDP, five times the current 0.6 per cent. Lithium might not have a futures market, continues to be input for a variety of industries: batteries, glass and ceramics, lubricants, medicine, metallurgy and polymers. With the global push for electric cars, the demand for Lithium will increase. Northwest of Argentina lies the Atacama plateau, with an average elevation of 4,500 m. It is common for visitors to suffer from altitude sickness due to a decrease in oxygen levels. In Argentine employ, Leonardo AW169 can fly at most 4,800 m, the Airbus H225 at 4,000 m, Bell 427 at 3,000 m and MD500 at 4,800 m. The Bell Model 412, Airbus H125, and Airbus H135 have more than 5,000 m in service ceilings. This severely limited airpower to access the plateau’s lithium reserves has impacted the country’s exploration activity. Since the lithium activities picked up in the 1990s, Argentina has not actively invested in fostering the industry. The latest government has been bringing a wave of change. And now, this wave is at the Indian shores to shop for the HAL LCH Prachand. Between Hell and Hope: HAL Helicopters The latest HAL LCH Prachand helicopter has the potential to answer Argentina’s lithium exploration needs. Its 6,500 m service ceiling can effortlessly fly over the Atacama plateau. HAL has also fitted it with state-of-the-art avionics: Elbit CoMPASS optoelectronic suite and Saab radar and laser warning system. With a stellar product line on paper, off-late HAL helicopters suffer from frequent crashes. In South America alone, HAL has been exporting to various countries. Infamously, Ecuador indefinitely grounded its entire HAL Dhruv, on which the LCH Prachand is based, after multiple crashes. The helicopters were last known to be up for sale by the Ecuadorian government. On 21st October 2022, HAL Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), in service with the Indian Army, crashed in Arunachal Pradesh. The crash claimed five lives, adding to a growing list of helicopter fatalities. This year, India also lost its Chief of Defence Staff in a helicopter crash in southern India. The ALH Rudra Mark IV is also based on the HAL Dhruv, like the HAL LCH Prachand. Since 2017, more than 30 people have lost their lives in helicopter crashes. There is a growing call from the Indian defence community to increase helicopter safety standards. There is a need for obstacle avoidance systems. The tough, rugged terrains of the mountainous expanse of the country beget solutions that allow pilots to see through clouds of smoke and dust roiled up by a helicopter downwash. Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) sensors are equipped onto American helicopters like the Pave Hawk search and rescue helicopter. It fuses real-time data from an array of sensors, including millimetre wave radar, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), infrared cameras and various apriori digital terrain data, which provides the pilot with a synthetic vision through extreme weather like rain, fog, smoke, dust, etc. According to the HAL website, only the ALH Mark IV features an obstacle avoidance system. This unknowingly exposes the priorities of the company. Given that a helicopter is an extremely complex aircraft with no ejection seat system, the lack of prioritising the safety of passengers is unnerving. While Argentina looks to HAL for a comprehensive defence partnership beyond the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, HAL’s infamous record automatically attaches itself. With no visible efforts to prioritize safety, HAL is collectively losing the trust of the Indian and global defence communities. Argentina can unlock its true lithium potential through HAL, provided HAL can translate the features on paper to the real world along with equally extraordinary reliability.

OPINION : Electronic Warfare An Indispensable Aspect Of Modern Warfare.,https://idrw.org/opinion-electronic-warfare-an-indispensable-aspect-of-modern-warfare/,"December 10, 2022","SOURCE: SEKHAR JYOTHI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Electronic warfare is inclusive of all actions in the entire electromagnetic spectrum to intercept , analyze, suppress or manipulate the spectrum usage of enemy as well as to protect the friendly forces’ use of the spectrum from same type of attack by an enemy. The electromagnetic spectrum includes both the visible and invisible spectrum ranges, measured in multiples of hertz of the spectrum. Electronic warfare has the capability to provide intelligence about enemy communication it has combat power like jamming, disruption, or deception of usage of spectrum ranges. An example of effective electronic warfare system would be the Russian R-330Zh Zhitel jammer which can shut down GPS, satellite communications, and cellphone networks in the VHF and UHF bands within a radius of ten kilometers . In EW electronic attack by deception is an integral part in which a system substitutes its own signal for an expected radar or radio transmission. As an example : Russian forces induced propagana and misleading orders to troops and civilians during the 2014–2022 take over of eastern Ukraine by hijacking the local cellular network with the RB-341V Leer-3 system. Having effective equipment alone is no guarantee that it will help to achieve the desired result or give the desired edge in the battle field or in the war as a whole. Russian electronic warfare equipment have drawn prasises from US war experts and any praise such as these are hard to come from a direct adversary. But in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukrain, Russian forces used electronic warfare to great effect. But the Russian implementation of EW also interfered with Russian operations, compounding the other problems its troops faced. During the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian electronic warfare equipments disrupted Ukraine’s air defense radars and communications links. Russian electronic warfare implementations severely disrupted Ukrainian S-300 and SA-11 surface-to-air-missile batteries north of Kyiv. The problem for Russian forces was that their electronic warfare also jammed their own communications and Russian forces had no methods of secured communications like single-channel ground and airborne radio system ( SINCGARS ) developed and used by NATO. This “electronic fratricide” became so acute that Russian troops had to stop disrupting Ukrainian communications which was one of the reasons which allowed Ukraine to fight back effectively and it was also the possible reason for which Russia had to loose many aircrafts to Uraininan ground defence systems in later stages of the war. Russian mobile air-defense units which were meant to keep up with the armored columns were hampered by poor communications. The end result was that Russia’s electronic offensive boomeranged. The opposite of electronic attack is electronic support (ES), which is used to passively detect and analyze an opponent’s transmission which is essential for understanding the potential vulnerabilities of an adversary’s usage of spectrum. Therefore, most electronic warfare systems include ES capabilities that allow them to find and quickly locate potential jamming targets. Using electronic support capabilities most electronic warfare systems can also locate enemy radio and cellphone transmissions and then pass that information on to the artillery and airforce units so that it can be used to direct accurate artillery or missile fire. As counter measures are almost always in demand to avoid any threa, new counter measures against interfering EW systems are also under development and one such development is to setup a laser communication between communicating equipment to eliminate the need of the electronic spectrum. Civilian transmissions mixed with military communication also prevents accurate geolocating of the military assets. Likewise, usage of inherently encrypted & severely frequency hopping transmissions make it very diffiult for interfering systems to interpret communicatins or even jam those. An example of such a system is single-channel ground and airborne radio system ( SINCGARS ) used by NATO. Russian troops do not have or use a system like SINCGARS and are often dependent on cellphones or unencrypted radios for coordination of operation. This makes them susceptible to geolocation by and jamming. In this way, stabilization of the front lines also helps Ukraine’s EW efforts because it allows quick correlation of transmissions to locations. Ukraine’s defenders also exploited a weakness of the large and powerful Russian EW system. Using U.S.-supplied ES gear, Ukrainian troops have been able to detect transmissions from systems like the Leer-3 or Krasukha-4 and direct rocket, artillery, and drone counterattacks against the truck-borne Russian systems It is pleasing to know that Indian defence has understood the importance of electronic warfare and has been doing research and development on electronic warfare which resulted into an effective EW system named Samyukta. Introduced in the year 2004 is a state-of-the-art mobile electronic warfare syste developed indigenously by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO. The integrated electronic warfare system is uniquely configured for frequencies for reconnaissance, direction finding, and position fixing, listing, prioritising and jamming adversaries’ emissions. Samyukta is built to ensure dominance over electro- magnetic spectrum by jamming enemy surveillance signals and voice and radar signals while ensuring its own signals are not jammed by the enemy. Samyukta, is a behemoth of a electronic warfare project achieved jointly by DRDO, Bharat Electronics Ltd, Electronics Corporation of India Ltd and Corps of Signals of the Indian Army. Other partners in building Samyukta included CMC and Tata Power Company Ltd (TPCL). For Indian defense there are other EW systems that have been and are in the process of development like KALI laser based electronic warfare system, Shakti electronic warfare system used by Indian Naval warships for interception, detection, classification, identification and jamming of conventional and modern Radars and there are more. Electronic warfare is an indispensable part of modern warfare and if implemented effectively can really be a game changer in a war enabling the effective implementors to get a decisive edge in annihiliating the adversary.

Infra-red homing missile tentatively classified as Astra-IR by the local media started as a variant but now has turned into a full-fledged engineering program that will see new technology incorporated into the missile for the development of a medium-range air-to-air missile that can even be fielded on 5th gen platforms. idrw.org has been told that the original idea was to only replace Ku Band AESA Seeker onboard Astra Mk1 and equip it with an Infra-red homing missile but as concept studies progressed it was decided that more next-gen technology needs to be developed for making it more deadly and accurate and to ensure that it’s also future ready. Astra IR will feature both rail and ejection launch modes and will be fine-tuned for detecting aerial targets with reduced infrared and electromagnetic signatures that usually are associated with 5th gen aircraft. Astra IR will have a superior range than the existing close combat missile like ASRAAM and Python-5 due to which it will incorporate certain changes in aerodynamics and the incorporation of technology that can match fast maneuvering jets.

OPINION : Is India being offered long-forgotten and dated engines for AMCA Program?,https://idrw.org/opinion-is-india-being-offered-long-forgotten-and-dated-engines-for-amca-program/,"October 14, 2022","SOURCE: DEEPAK HILORI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG India which is looking to co-develop a new engine for its 5th Generation AMCA fighter jet program has been offered 3 engines that will meet India’s requirements and the offer has come from three major aerospace engine manufacturers in the world. While India has been offered a complete Transfer of technology for this engine with some portion of Intellectual property rights on certain sections of the engine but none of them are clean slate design and these engines are still based on the engines that were designed nearly 30 years ago. American General Electric, which is the world’s biggest Aero-engine manufacturer has offered India F-414-400 enhanced engines that due to modifications to its core will be able to generate a thrust range of 110-130kN that India is seeking. F-414 is based on the proven design base of its F404 predecessor which entered production in 1998. F414 delivers 35% more thrust than the original F404 that was first tested in 1976. General Electric has been the weakest contender in India due to tight export control restrictions of the United States state policies and lack of transfer of technology of the core that will further limit its chances of sucess. sanctions post-nuclear explosion by India on the very same engine used on the Tejas program is still fresh in the memories of many and its win probability is quite low. F-414 engines were used in the first gen F-117 stealth attack aircraft with a limited build but largely used only on 4.5gen fighter jets as the United States has developed clean slate engines for both its F-22 and F-35 programs. F-414 engines do not have thermal reduction measures nor are tuned for usage on 5th gen platforms nor can be called advanced enough to be used even 40-50 years down the line. The second offer comes from the Second largest aero-engine maker that seems to be in some sort of financial trouble in the recent few years but is still going strong. Rolls Royce has offered to develop a new upgraded variant that will be based on the EJ-200 engine that is powered on the Eurofighter Typhoon jets. Rolls Royce had worked on the concept of developing a more powerful EJ-200 way back in the late 90s for the Tranche 3 Eurofighter Typhoon program but that was never approved for cost reasons and the same has been offered to India. EJ-200 had its first run in 1991 and Rolls Royce has no plans to use an upgraded or use EJ-200 as a base for the development of a new engine for its 6th Gen Tempest program due to technical issues that could have required rework of its entire core to achieve desired thermal managememt for the 6th gen fighter jet. With orders for Eurofighter on the decline, EJ-200 production is more or less will be only to serve its existing customers, and the production rate will be the bare minimum due to which Rolls Royce won’t have an issue offering complete ToT for engines that it no longer as a product to sell as a package. The front runner to win this deal is French aerospace major Safran which has offered its M-88 engine that is already powering India’s Rafale fighter jet fleet. M-88 is the weakest engine of the three when it comes to developing maximum thrust and also the oldest that was conceived in the mid-80s. M-88 engine over the last three decades had received several upgrades to its core to improve its Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and to increase its lifespan but never to increase its thrust. Safran had planned an M88-4E ECO engine that had a thrust range of 105-115kN but this engine remained a concept and was never fully developed. M-88 in its present core will be not enough to generate 110 to 130kN of thrust and the M-88-4E proposed core requires major engine rework which is why it never cleared the concept stage. France which is working on the 6th generation FCAS program with Germany and Spain is working on a clean slate engine for this program and will be not considering the M-88 family to power them. Conclusion: All three engines on offer to India are pretty much dated and based on technology that was conceived in the late 80s or mid-90s. This same engine that they are offering India to power India’s 5th-gen fighter jet is not being considered to power their 5th and 6th-gen fighter jet program. India has plans to develop an upgraded engine for its 6th gen program but the tech on offer is pretty outdated and doesn’t have thermal signature management nor any hybrid system integrated to power fighter jets that will come 25-30 years from now."

India worked with other countries to block a resolution against AUKUS that was moved by China at the recent IAEA general conference. The nuclear attack submarine that Australia plans to build and operate in Indo-Pacific will help in tracking the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and countries like India and Australia must cooperate in putting together a security grid for the IOR that will mutually be beneficial to both in tackling the rise of China. India is also working on the development of Nuclear attack submarines for its Navy but unlike Australia, India is not getting any direct technology from the UK and the US due to which it has to rely on Russia for its assistance in the development of this niche technology. India has set in motion plans to lease two Akula class nuclear attack submarines for 10 years that will play a crucial role not only to keep eye on the Chinese Navy in the IOR but also help Indian engineers and scientists work on Indian Nuclear attack submarines at its pace. Western countries have been hard on India to detach itself from Russian weapons and have threatened sanctions in past for procuring Russian S-400 systems and Russian oil. India has explained why it continues to procure Russian systems but there is a high chance that leasing Akula submarines from Russia for approx 3 Billion each might be seen negatively and it is important that foreign services already start making attempts to get western diplomats on its side before the western press starts attacking India again. Leasing two Akula class submarines are not only crucial for India’s security needs but also in its quest for developing six next-gen attack submarines for its Navy.

Six A-321S that are presently grounded will soon start the process of refurbishment of the aircraft including getting new engines along with changes to worn-out components. The refurbishment will be carried out locally in India including the removal of standard seats and the upgradation of avionics to military-grade standards by a French company along with its Indian partner. Aircraft need to be rewired entirely along with that it needs to be reconfigured for military usage, which includes soundproofing cabin and installation of auxiliary power units. All A321s will be fixed with a dual-sided electronically scanned antenna array that will be installed in a rectangular housing, dorsally mounted above the fuselage. Aircraft also need to be fitted with mission operator consoles on the starboard side. Electronic warfare suite and Electronic support measures systems too will be installed. A321-based Netra 2.0 AEW&CS will have new improved and upgraded radar that has an instrumental range of 500km and a detection range of 400km.

Indian Army which operates nearly 2000 of the BMP-2 ICVs that were licensed and produced in India for decades has been closely watching the performance of these ICVs in the recent Ukraine war. BMP-2 has shown some remarkable ability to take hits from Western-supplied anti-armor supplies but the system is aging and won’t survive long on a modern battlefield to enhance its firepower Indian BMP-2 ICV fleet will be getting a modern fire-control system, and an automatic target tracker. BMP-2 ICVs that were night blind finally will be getting see-through armor that has been developed by Indian Private sector companies that not only provide 360-degree coverage of the battlefield but also allow the crew to work even in pitch dark. The advantage of this Indian-made see-through armor is that it has been tailor-made as per Indian Army requirements by three different companies and works as expected under Indian ambiance conditions much better than imported ones as informed to idrw.org. The biggest tech upgrade for the 800 BMP-2 ICVs will come with capabilities to integrate and operate anti-armor loitering munitions that can be used to take out heavily fortified command posts or even attack advancing troops. The development of anti-armor loitering munition is already under work with Indian Private sector companies and equipping them with such sophisticated suicide drones for offensive and defensive capabilities will only enhance their ability to survive in the modern warzone. Upgraded BMP-2 ICVs will be a precursor to what will be is expected in the Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) program that the Indian Army will be developing with Indian defense PSUs and Private sector companies to replace the older lot of BMP-2 ICVs that have completed their technical life."
"OPINION : IAF@90, What went wrong with the trajectory",https://idrw.org/opinion-iaf90-what-went-wrong-with-the-trajectory/,"October 11, 2022","SOURCE: DEEPAK HILORI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Indian Air Force (IAF) recently celebrated 90 years of its existence at a time when Two front war is looking more and more realistic but dwindling squadrons levels are also hard hit reality, IAF is heading towards rock bottom in terms of its ability to field combat jets that will propositionally affect its operational capabilities in case of a full-fledged war. The last two decades have been the most unproductive decades for the IAF in terms of building levels of its capabilities. Plans to locally manufacture 126 jets to boost its combat squadrons have failed to take off and its step-motherly treatment towards the indigenous LCA-Tejas program has only aggravated this situation. Till 2020, IAF was not sure of the Tejas Mk1A program and even the Tejas MKII program had been stuck due to fear that it will cripple the chances of IAF acquiring foreign jets from abroad. Walking out of the FGFA program and placing orders for only 36 Rafale fighter jets meant the fighter acquisition program had gone for a toss without any concrete levels of work being undertaken and IAF was forced to go back to the Tejas Mk1 program and rework with HAL to develop an upgraded fighter jet that started as Mig-21 replacement that fell out of favor with top brass immediately after the program started picking momentum from 2006 onwards. Tejas MKII which was to replace mid-tier fighter jets of the IAF suddenly was not so front-runner anymore with the new chief in charge and it took nearly a year before IAF committed to procuring 120 jets if and when it is ready. While we do not know what happened in the backroom and what made the IAF chief finally admit that the Tejas MKII program is happening that will remain a mystery but many were relieved that it was finally happening even though a bit late. IAF has been pretty late to join the 5th gen bandwagon and the AMCA program since its inception has moved quietly slowly even now there seems to be no urgency to fast-track the program as it will not be ready before 2035 when it will start getting 5th gen platform in numbers. IAF again has committed to procuring around 120 jets which is only possible if it can develop a new engine for the program but at the pace at which negotiations have been going, it will not be surprising that the program will see some further delays. When it comes to Force multipliers like AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System), IAF is playing catch up with smaller arch-rivals like Pakistan in terms of aircraft at its disposal. The air force with a much smaller budget and resources was not only able to field more AWACS aircraft but also exposed rot inside IAF’s procurement system that has failed the test of time. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fleet of IAF again showcases the sorry state of affairs, Air force claims to be the fourth biggest in the world but doesn’t have any armed UAVs nor any HALE class UAVs at its disposal when all recent wars have shown the importance of UAVs in all spectrum of war. IAF@100 hopefully will see a new emerging air force that is rebuilding itself and looking within the country to meet most of its requirements. IAF at 100 might not be in a position to claim it has the combat jets that it wants but IAF@110 should be an ideal goal to reach that sacred 42 Squadron strength with 70% of combat squadrons made up of locally manufactured fighter jets."

Turbojet-Powered Loitering Munition will be much faster than propeller-driven Loitering Munition which will help it evade air defense systems much better and lower reaction time for the enemy air defense crew. Turbojet-Powered Loitering Munition will have a two-way data link and an integrated dual electro-optic/infrared sensor that can operate day and night and offer much better performance in adverse weather conditions at higher altitudes where the weather can play a crucial factor. Turbojet-Powered Loitering Munition will be cheaper than Air Launched Cruise Missiles which are much more expensive.

OPINION : Abrams X Program shows How India’s Arjun Mk1A should have progressed into FRCV,https://idrw.org/opinion-abrams-x-program-shows-how-indias-arjun-mk1a-should-have-progressed-into-frcv/,"October 10, 2022","SOURCE: RAJESH AHUJA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Indian Army is looking to procure a 1770 Future Ready Combat Vehicle (FRCV) that will replace the Indian Army’s fleet of Soviet-era T-72 tanks from 2030 onwards. FRCV is targeted for induction in 2030 but the technology sought under this program that has been linked with the mechanized infantry modernization plan requires no subtitle improvements over Arjun Mk-1A but some of the radical changes that mean it will be completely not based on the Arjun tank that includes much-criticized weight of the tank and completely different chassis. Recently revealed Abrams X has been the United States’ primary tank since the mid-1980s, Over the years several modifications and improvements have been produced and Abrams X only shows its commitment to keep improving established products rather than go for a completely new design and a class of tank. FRCV will be around 50 tonnes in weight which is nearly 15-17 tonnes less than what Arjun-MK1A is at present. Army also has a complicated wishlist for FRCV that includes a new 1500HP Power plant and other hosts of improvements that includes AI-Network centric warfare capability, improved night fighting capabilities, and a switch from the current rifle gun to the smoothbore gun as its main armament. It has been specified in some media reports that Loitering ammunition are also been requested to be integrated into FRCV. loitering munitions could be very efficient weapons against tanks and armored vehicles as some can be designed to conduct anti-tank missions but such weapons are limited by the space that is available on the turret and can’t be the main armament of the tank. These gradual changes could have easily been accommodated on the Arjun Mk2 variant that now has been canceled for the FRCV which will be a new tank that will take much more time to develop and complete its testing phase and it is unlikely new tank will be ready for production in only 7 years, even though Army is yet to issue its General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs) for the FRCV.

OPINION : Will universal missile launchers gain ascendancy?,https://idrw.org/opinion-will-universal-missile-launchers-gain-ascendancy/,"October 9, 2022","SOURCE: DINESH BEHARA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Remember the days when one was visiting a destination had to carry multiple things, such as travel documents, a music player or FM radio to enjoy the travel, a mobile phone to communicate with dear ones, a camera to capture the sightseeing, places, moments, etc. do we carry things in the same way even now? not necessarily right! one smartphone has probably got all the functions of these multiple devices. Let’s look at another example, we have so many types of screw heads like slotted, phillips, six-lobe, hexagon, double-square, etc. a technician had to carry multiple drivers for each of these screw heads, but it is not necessarily required, because alternatively a technician can carry a screwdriver set which has common holder/handle and the tips can be attached according to the application. Likewise, there are so many different types of launchers for missiles that fire only a specific type of missile. So, is there any alternative? Missiles are short-range, long-range, high-altitude, attack, air-defense, supersonic, subsonic, cruise, etc. each type of these missile differs in its dimensions, weight, and electronics which are designed to the specific configuration. Now, the canister/launcher for any of these types of missiles is also different. So basically, a launcher/canister can fire only one type of missile. To address this shortcoming countries such as the United States, China and Russia have designed or deployed launch systems that can fire multiple missiles, which are called as Universal vertical launch systems (UVLS) or Adaptable launch systems (ALS). Mark.41VLS (USA) This is a ship-borne Vertical Launch System present in allied forces warships along with the United States Navy. This system can fire missiles such as RIM-66 Standard, RIM-67 Standard, RIM-161 Standard Missile 3, RIM-174 Standard ERAM, RGM-109 Tomahawk, RUM-139 VL-ASROC anti-submarine missile, RIM-7 Sea Sparrow anti-air missile, RIM-162 ESSM. There’s also Mark.57 VLS which is an improved version of Mark.41 GJB 5860-2006 (China) The People’s Liberation Army Navy doesn’t have a standard name but ‘GJB 5860-2006’ is a technical document that outlines the standards for VLS, these systems are commonly called concentric canister launch (CCL). These systems are capable of both hot and cold launches. This VLS system can fire missiles such as YJ-18 anti-ship missiles, YJ-21 anti-ship missiles, HHQ-9 SAM, and CJ-10 land-attack cruise missiles. UKSK-M (Russia) This is an upcoming UVLS of Russia, which can fire operational missiles like antiaircraft, cruise, antiship, antisubmarine, and perspective hypersonic 3M22 missiles (Tsirkon). 5P85TE2 (Russia) This is a 10×10 wheeled launcher consisting of 4 tubes associated with the S-400 air defense system. 5P85TE2 can transport and vertically fire combination of surface-to-air missiles, such as 4 x 48N6E2 (200km) or 48N6E3 (250km), 2 x 40N6E (400km) long range or 12 x 9M96E (40km) or 9M96E2 (120km) high maneuverable missiles. A 48N6E missile launcher can be replaced by three 9M96E missiles. So, the 5P8TE2 is an adaptable launch system as well. These Multi mission missile launchers offer various advantages (Specially to warships) such as:• It can carry any type of missile based on offensive/defensive missions• Allows greater flexibility to warship design and manufacturing• Reduced maintenance or modification costs of launch systems• New missiles can be introduced to universal/adaptable launchers easily• These canister/launchers can carry one large missile or pack of small missiles When a universal/adaptable launcher is designed, it is made in such a way that the canister/launcher can accommodate missiles of various dimensions and masses. Also, when next-generation or future missiles are designed, then these missiles can be easily integrated into these launchers. since new missiles can be designed keeping universal launchers in mind. Long-range missiles would be large & heavy whereas small or medium-range missiles would be comparatively less heavy. Either one large missile (or) pack of small missiles with help of fixtures can be mounted to these launchers making them very adaptable and flexible as to required missions. India’s arsenal consists of an array of missiles from imported to indigenous ones, but we are lagging in the category of Universal or adaptable launch systems. Look at the Indian Navy’s most prominent weapons in the frontline warships. Brahmos is an Indo-Russian collaboration and Barak-8 is an Indo-Israeli collaboration, hence both have different design configurations with their launcher systems. Both missiles are VLS configured. If India manages to design a canister/launcher that can accommodate and fire both missiles for future warships, then that would allow greater flexibility for the navy in its mission configuration. For example, if a warship is going on an offensive mission, then it can carry higher number of Brahmos missiles and lesser Barak-8 or if a warship is in an air-defense mission then it will be vice versa. It would be politically difficult for India to convince two countries to collaborate onsharing software launch codes of missiles to integrate them into one launcher. India Should start developing new missile systems with Universal or adaptable launchers. The system should be capable of firing a variety of missiles like air defense, cruise, anti-ship, surface-to-surface, etc. This would allow future warships to be multi-mission ready. Since weapons loadout configuration wouldn’t be a worrisome factor. Warships with Universal/adaptable systems would make weapons replenishment and logistics handling easier than warships with multiple types of missiles. India should also develop a land-based system with erector launcher vehicles that should be able to fire surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles of different ranges.

As far as the ToT clause goes, F-35 made in India will require to have an eco-system of its spares and supply chain that could require local production at any given point of time so that it is not affected by external supply chain issues that can’t be interrupted by war or sanctions. Making the entire F-35 fleet operated by the Indian Air Force sanction-proof will be a huge task for India since the American administration will like to control the technology that indirectly allows them to maintain pressure on the host country that operates the American weapon system on various International issues. Americans won’t like Indian-operated F-35 near any base that has been installed with a Russian S-400 Air defense system not even in its vicinity due to fear that Russians will have backdoor entry to the Tracking sensors that will be able to track aircraft and captures its radar signature which in turn will help Russians to improve it tracking algorithms for F-35 aircraft that will be operated by other NATO countries. India of late has been developing air-launched weapons of its own like beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles or anti-radiation missiles. India wants to have its entire fighter fleet have common weapons system that is not exclusive only to one type due to logistical challenges but this will be a huge task to incorporate Indian systems on American jets as a very small percentage of countries have such privileged access and even this countries still use a majority of the American made weapons on this platforms."

Prachand will start trials with the anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) from next year onwards, ATGMs are often the main weapon system on any Attack Helicopter, and Prachand must get its way before it enters bulk production. India is also developing long-range ATGMs that will allow Prachand enough stand-off range that can ensure its safety and efforts are also being made to get it ready for production soon. Prachand is equipped with Mistral Air to-Air missile to take down hostile UAS but India will soon also have a local substitute from the DRDO’s MANPAD program that will see an air-to-air missile powered by an infrared seeker. Air-launched mini-drone program for helicopters like Prachand is also happening. The private sector company is working on the development of mini-drones that can launch from helicopters to find enemy targets, operate under enemy fire, and send instant target coordinates and key surveillance details to human decision-makers. mini-drones will be used for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions. Prachand will be the first attack helicopter that will be getting ALFA-S swarming drones which can be air-launched from its pod and has a range of 100km. Each pod can carry 2 or four ALFA-S and each Prachand will be able to carry two pods that are armed on a dozen Prachand will mean it will take out crucial command posts and other forward positions of the enemy without actually coming too close to its air defense system. Prachand being made in India will allow Indian designers and engineers far more flexibility to upgrade its armaments and weapon systems with next-gen technology much faster than what Apache can offer. Prachand in the next decade or more will evolve as a much better platform than Apache in terms of technology.

Chaudhari might have opened Pandora’s box when he gave his blessing for the possibility of IAF considering the 5th gen platform for its requirements of 114 jets under the Multirole fighter aircraft (MRFA) competition. The F-35 lobby in India seems to have been triggered by the candid admission of the IAF Chief and already articles are coming out about why F-35 will be suitable over Rafale. Lockheed Martin has offered its F-16V which has been rebadged as the F-21 as its contender under MRFA tender but it has zero chance of winning the contract from India for obvious reasons. Pentagon officials and the US administration have not authorized Lockheed Martin to offer an F-35 to India due to which intense lobbying was activated back in India for the last few years, which has been trying to create pressure in India so that India instead asks for F-35s from the United States. If India puts requests or shows interest in acquiring 5th gen platform from any country that is willing to offer one that could mean Russia will step in and offer a Su-75 or Su-57 which could force the United States to counter this move and offer an F-35 in response to any offer made by Russia. Reports of Lockheed Martin working on India-specific customized F-35S like the Israeli F-35 Adir has been going around and Lockheed has been sending feelers to the IAF for a while now. The order for 114 jets is not small when you consider that the biggest F-35 order outside USAF is coming from Japan which is planning a total of 147 jets with local production rights that’s just 33 units more than the possible Indian order if it materializes. MRFA contract signing is not going to happen any time soon and when it does it will take another 5-6 years before contracted aircraft are manufactured and delivered to Indian Air Force which will shift the timeline to the late 20s. The lobby is already making a strong case for going with 5th gen aircraft rather than for a 4.5 gen aircraft when the world is already started work on the 6th jet program that will start emerging pretty soon.

CATS Warrior Air Intakes seems to have gone through massive changes from its earlier mock-up that was displayed at Aero India. CATS Warrior mock-up was displayed with traditional air inlets, now CATS Warrior is seen with a narrower air inlet duct on top of the fuselage. idrw.org in its previous report had mentioned that CATS Warrior is going through design changes and this new rendering might be highlighting those changes. CATS Warrior can be seen with NG-CCM aka ASRAAM Close Combat Missile that has a range of over 25km to be used to safeguard Mothership (TejasMaX) or any other Mannedfighter jet that it is part of the formation in missions over contested airspace. CATS Warrior will be powered by HAL-developed HAL PTAE-7 turbofan in a Twin-engine configuration with a chevron exhaust. CATS HALE is a high-speed, high-altitude unmanned combat aerial vehicle that can perform wide-area surveillance and time-sensitive strike missions over land or sea. Since HAL has given very few details about its specification but it is expected it will be powered by a single HTFE-25 engine with an All-up weight (AUW) of around 5 tons."

OPINION : Why MRFA Door is closing fast for IAF,https://idrw.org/opinion-why-mrfa-door-is-closing-fast-for-iafopinion/,"November 19, 2022","SOURCE: DEEPAK HILORI/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Indian Defence Ministry in 2023 will be in a dilemma as it will be asked by its premier Aeronautical nodal design agency in the country to clear two major fighter jet projects that will require combined project funds of 28000 crores which are close to over $3.6Billion after it recently cleared 10000 crores for another fighter jet project in 2022. India is actively working on four fighter jet programs simultaneously for its armed force, yet the Indian Air Force is still looking to procure 114 jets under its MMRFA tender that was issued in 2018. Tejas Mk1A, an upgraded baseline Tejas Mk1 with six major improvements and over dozen changes and upgrades to its components will start arriving from 2024 onwards that will fill the void left by the Mig-21 Squadrons that IAF plans to complete phase-out by 2025 onwards. Tejas Mk2, also called LCA AF Mk2 is a new medium-class fighter jet that is in development to replace all its current Medium class fighter jets like Mig-29, Mirage-2000, and Jaguar fighters from 2029 onwards with a production run planned till late in the 2030s. AMCA, a 5th gen fighter that India claims will be at par with the likes of F-35 and J-20 is planned to commence its prototype testing flights from 2026 onwards with production planned from 2032 onwards for which it is seeking 15000 crores as Research and Development fund. Even though it is a 25-ton fighter jet same as Rafale it will be replacing older batches of Su-30MKI fighter jets from 2040 onwards and will be top-tier aircraft in the fighter fleet. India also has plans to develop a Deck-based fighter jet called TEDBF which will be another 26-ton fighter jet that is in the same class as Rafale and AMCA but falls in the 4.5++gen class. TEDBF design seems to have adopted a low observable front section and will utilize most of the tech that has been developed for the AMCA program thus bringing it to par with 5th gen fighter jets even though it’s not. TEDBF is an interesting program since over 13000-crores will be spent on its development while the Navy has requirements only for 45 units that might rise to three digit number if gets approval for the 3rd aircraft carrier. IAF is very much focused on the LCA AF Mk2 and AMCA programs and if Indian PSUs that are notorious for delays can meet delivery schedules it will make it difficult for the air force to continue to pursue MRFA tenders for foreign jets when it already has two fighter jets program already running in the country, not to forget that TEDBF can be customized for air force if it is willing thus in future it will have 3 fighter jets options to chose from locally thus giving a small window of opportunity for IAF to evaluate and crack a deal for MRFA in next 3-4 years."

IAF chief for the first time confirmed that the air force is now open to the idea of a 5th gen platform which was not the case earlier. Till now only proposals that have been received from prospective OEMs have been about their 4.5gen fighter jets. Only Russia’s Su-75 Checkmate has been officially offered to the Indian Air Force but the aircraft is still in the design phase and it is unlikely that IAF will be interested in the procurement of the Su-75. The only other 5th gen fighter in production is the Su-57 that IAF walked out due to disagreements on the technical aspect of the workshare agreements.

In the first Phase, this new facility can manufacture 30 LUH per year which will be enhanced to 60 per year in Second Phase. The facility was also equipped to manufacture Russian Ka-226 Helicopters but it is likely that deal to procure this helicopter won’t go any further and nearly 200 Ka-226 that were to be procured from Russia and made locally in this facility might be converted into orders for the LUH since both are in the same class of Helicopters and to keep the same type."

India might revive 90 kN thrust engine plans,https://idrw.org/india-might-revive-90-kn-thrust-engine-plans/,"September 26, 2022","SOURCE: IDRW NEWS NETWORK The Dry Kaveri engine core is now being made stable due to critical breakthroughs in key technologies over the years, leading to successful certification of the engine that might be completed by 2026. Dry Kaveri engine can generate a 46kN Class of thrust that will be used in the Indian Unmanned Strike Air Vehicle (IUSAV) program but DRDO has now started working on a new afterburner section that is not for the IUSAV program but might be used for a new derivate that might be cleared post-certification of the Dry Kaveri engine program. idrw.org has been told that proposal under consideration if the Dry Kaveri engine program meets the deadline and enters production could be to develop an uprated core that can generate 57-60kN class of Dry thrust which when mated to the afterburner section can generate a maximum thrust of 85-90kN. This engine will be ideal to be equipped on the Tejas Mk1A fleet when they are due to engine change sometime in the mid-2030s. Tejas Mk1A fleet is powered by an American F404-GE-IN20 turbofan engine that can generate 84kN of Wet Thrust and over 40 years, each Tejas Mk1A will be requiring on average 3.5 engine swaps for the entire duration of its operational life. While the in-ground trial Dry Kaveri engine has demonstrated great core stability and has achieved the required thrust but it still waiting for high-altitude trials that were scheduled to have been taken place earlier this year but have been delayed due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. India is also in talks with Safran and Rolls-Royce for the development of a new hybrid engine for the AMCA program that can generate 110-120kN Class of thrust. A New co-developed engine will also be tuned and hardened with additional safety measures for single engine operations to be used on the Second batch of Tejas MkII. Marine variant of the same engine for shipborne fighters like TEDBF will also be developed, but this engine won’t make it to the older Tejas Mk1A type due to which uprated Kaveri engine talks are taking place even though its success depends on certification of the Dry Kaveri engine and serial production of the engine."

India’s Military Drone Arsenal: A Primer,https://idrw.org/indias-military-drone-arsenal-a-primer%ef%bf%bc/,"September 23, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. Every military expert agrees that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are the future of combat. Knowing the most prevalent types of drones and which ones India has deployed is essential. Three Decades in Operation: A Brief History of UAVs in IndiaFor almost a decade, the Indian Armed Forces have used UAVs. The Indian Army acquired unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from Israel in the late 1990s, and the Indian Air Force and Navy followed suit.Initially, DRDO was charged with creating a catapult-launched UAV, which its Aeronautical Development Establishment, Bangalore, built and improved to satisfy customer specifications. IAI Malat, whose UAVs were in service with several armies, supplied the Indian Armed Forces with most of its UAVs. The Indian Army first got the Searcher Mark I, then the Searcher Mark II, which had a maximum operating height of 15,000 feet, and ultimately the Heron, which had a maximum operating altitude of 30,000 feet. The Indian Air Force received the Searcher Mark I, followed by the Searcher Mark II, and the Heron unmanned aerial vehicles before the Indian Army. The Indian Navy also bought Heron UAVs, which met its needs for long-range off-shore operations.According to unconfirmed rumours, the Indian Air Force acquired the Harop in 2019, similar to a UCAV. Since 2006, successive IAF Chiefs of Staff have stressed this capability, and the IAF expects to have both UAV and UCAV squadrons utterly operational by 2017. Notably, Harop made its debut in 2009 at Aero India. This hunter-killer drone, manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), does not carry armaments like U.S. UCAVs but resembles a flying missile exploding on a pre-programmed target. This missile drone can hover over a battlefield and attack high-value targets, including Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) operations. Defence UAVs of India The purpose of a UAV is determined by its payload. The payload is closely linked to the task. Charged Couple Device (CCD) cameras with Multi Optronic Software (MOS) payload would be necessary for surveillance missions. The UAV would be outfitted with a Laser designator for missions using lasers, enabling aircraft to conduct more accurate attacks. Similarly, a UAV would be equipped with an ELINT payload for ELINT missions and sufficient explosives for hunter-killer operations. It could launch or crash into a designated target in an attack and self-destruct mode. For an offensive mission, the payload would consist of the guidance system and two missiles with the proper equipment. Micro and Nano Drones For several years, insect-sized surveillance robots have hovered over actual battlefields. The Indian Army is scouting for a Micro Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (Micro RPAS). Mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). The tender is on, and the results are not there yet. Small Tactical DronesThe Indian Army already uses Mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems of unknown make but made in India. Mini RPAS eliminates the tactical operating limits imposed by Indian Air Force aircraft and heron Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The Indian Army has also acquired Swarm Drones from two Indian startups. These drones are estimated to be in the small tactical drone category. The Indian Army has also launched a Make-II case for the Autonomous Surveillance and Armed Drone Swarm (A-SADS), which includes several enhancements, including a High Altitude Area variant. Medium-sized Reconnaissance Drones Most military drones, or “work horses”, are medium-sized, medium-range flying UAVs used for ISTAR missions. These drones, like bigger surveillance drones, are sometimes referred to as MALE or HALE drones, abbreviations for Medium Altitude Long Endurance and High Altitude Long Endurance.India has been using Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI)-manufactured Heron, one of the most critical drones in this category worldwide. This drone, which weighs over 1,000 kilograms and has a wingspan of over 16 metres, can fly for up to 52 hours at 10,000 metres (35,000 feet) – almost the same altitude as an aeroplane. Currently, India possesses more than 200 Israeli-made Searcher and Heron UAVs. The Indian defence ministry authorised the purchase of 54 Israeli Harop drones in February 2019 to strengthen its unmanned combat capabilities. Approximately 110 Harop drones are already in service with the Indian Air Force (IAF). DRDO has created the Rustom I & II MALE UAVs for survival and strike. Rustom-2, also known as Tapas-BH (Tactical Airborne Platform for Aerial Surveillance-Beyond Horizon 201), completed its last flight test in October 2020, flying at 16,000 feet for eight hours. It recently flew at an altitude of 25,000 feet and an endurance of 10 hours. 76 Tapas drones have been ordered – sixty for the Indian Army, twelve for the Indian Air force, and four for the Indian Navy. The first delivery is scheduled for 2023. This is a collaboration between HAL and DRDO. TAPAS BH-201 UCAV must reach 30,000 feet, which it has almost accomplished, and has shown an endurance (hours spent in the sky) of over 16 hours.The Indian Navy has leased two MQ-9B sea Guardian UAVs from the United States and is currently buying 30 units. Large Combat and Surveillance Drones India has no plans for this category of drones except for the DRDO Ghatak project. Ghatak is an unmanned, jet-propelled, stealthy combat aircraft (UCAV). Future of UAVs in India’s Military Strategy India has sufficiently understood the importance of drones. To this effect, India has been gearing up for a massive boost to the indigenous industry under its various programmes. Specifically, under iDEX, India is looking to develop world-class drones that plug specific long-haul operational requirements. Further, India’s indigenisation path has started to build critical subsystems locally. Kaveri’s famed engine programme is bound to help develop powerful UAVs for India. Thanks in part to its space programme, India’s software and sensor prowess will be coupled with its growing industry to produce a global drone powerhouse.

United States, China, and some European countries have started work on 6th gen fighter jets that will go into production sometime in 2035-40, and it’s important that India too start preliminary research work on 6th gen fighters so that it becomes reality by 2040-45. India has been late to join in the development of 5th gen fighter jets but various technologies that are in development will make AMCA sit just above all present 5th gen fighter jets, unofficially making it the first 5.5gen fighter when it enters production in 2035. while the definition of 6th gen fighter is still sketchy but the incorporation of AI and hybrid engines with better thermal management is some of the areas that will define a 6th gen fighter jet said the official. What the user (Air Force ) might want in 6th gen fighter cant to be predicated right now but we are studying new emerging technologies that will eventually find their way into a 6th gen fighter said a key official to idrw.org."
Tejas Mk1A will require deep modification to replace IFR Probe,https://idrw.org/tejas-mk1a-will-require-deep-modification-to-replace-ifr-probe/,"September 24, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Replacing the Inflight-refueling probe on LCA-Tejas Mk1 with a different probe made by a different vendor will require not only structural modification but also require a change in the internal fuel pipeline system that will require expensive redesign on the internals of the aircraft warned Ex-PSU official to idrw.org. The official who wants to be unnamed said that not only HAL needs to find another vendor to develop an IFR probe customized for the LCA-Tejas Mk1 aircraft but also will need to go through a series of recertification trials. Trials will involve extensive ground tests of the air-to-air refueling system followed up with a series of dry docking of aerial refueling probes and later Wet (actual) engagement refueling trials from a mid-air refueling tanker. It is estimated that it will take nearly two years to find a new vendor and complete whole recertification trials from the ground up and can be accomplished only if the User (Argentina ) is ready to wait for this capability to be enabled post delivery. These additional expenses might need to be borne by HAL which will cut into the profit margins of the aircraft since it is for a small order of 18 jets. LCA-Tejas Mk1A aircraft will be getting a British aerospace Cobham Limited developed Inflight-refueling probe while the internals of the aircraft including its piping and fuel pump was designed locally, change of probe to match to the same specification will not be possible due to Intellectual property (IP) of the company that is not with HAL."

B-21 Raider bears a familiar resemblance to the B-2 Spirit and will be the first mass-produced low observable stealth heavy strategic bomber that will come with a price tag that was never heard of before indicating B-21 will be the next F-35 in the heavy strategic bomber class that might not be not as good as its predecessor but might be open for export. B-21 Raider will differ substantially in size, and likely come with two engines instead of four engines and payload when compared to the B-2 Spirit and a lot has been achieved in terms of development of the low-observable technology to make it highly affordable in terms of unit cots. B-2 Spirit like F-22 was very expensive to manufacture and due to its low production run, it overshot the estimated unit cost by several hundred million. While only 21 B-2 spirits were manufactured at $2.1 billion per unit cost B-21 Raider will cost only $440 million per unit and will be replacing B-1 Lancer heavy strategic bomber with a production run ensured for 130 units. B-21 Raider is half the size of the B-2 in terms of payload and size due to which the cost of production will be a quarter of what B-21 was manufactured decades ago. Many in the US administration are of the opinion that B-21 Raider should be made available to close American allies, especially countries that can afford them and face a high level of threats from China and Russia. Name going around includes Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and India as some of the countries that should be offered B-21 Raider since these countries can’t manufacture their own and face the highest level of threats from either China or Russia. Will B-21 Raider will be made available for export will depend a lot on future geopolitical situations and the possibility of acceleration of conflicts in the Indo-Pacific. It is still not clear if countries like India will be interested in such an expensive purchase but anything under $500 per unit is not expensive since we are buying a $100 per unit Predator drone, India can afford a squadron.

India had agreed to replace the LCA-Tejas Mk1A British Martin Baker Ejection seat with Russian-supplied ones and the Chinese had agreed to do the same and replace the British Martin Baker Ejection seat with a locally developed Chinese ejection seat. Argentine jet trainer manufacturer FAdeA has equipped its new IA-63 Pampa III trainer/light attack aircraft with American The Universal Propulsion CoS-III-S3IA63 zero/zero ejection seats and operations have been smooth so far due to which preference for the American ejection seat is growing but it is not clear if they have issues only with Russian ejection seats or also with Chinese ejection seat that might put both LCA-Tejas and JF-17 bid in the back seat since Americans are also offering used F-16s to Argentina. Its to be seen if HAL selects an American or Russian Ejection seat for Argentina to deal, before that it will need to change the firing sequence and make design changes to the aircraft canopy, and also create special training and repair manuals for the ground crew before it can be recertified for the new ejection seat."

In early 2006, the Pakistani Air Force placed an order for 500 AIM-120C-5 missiles as part of a $650 million F-16 ammunition contract, since then American administration has refused to resupply these missiles and has also denied a request to provide them upgraded C8. With the Discontinuation of the C5 production, any possible window of Pakistan getting replenishment stock for its F-16 fleet is more or less over. Only 19 countries will be getting future upgrades when the latest AIM-120D3 variant is available for the export market and current operators have already upgraded to the C8 variant which is in production. To mitigate the issue of ending with no bvr missiles for its F-16 fleet, Pakistan has started talks with Turkey to procure Bozdogan a short-range infrared homing, and Gokdogan a beyond visual range active radar homing missiles for its F-16 fleet. But Gokdogan beyond visual range air-to-air missile is still inferior to C5 in range and comes with a claimed range of 60km while C5 had claimed range of 110km. AMRAAMs have a shelf life of 12-14 years if maintained in their storage container and after 10 years their battery needs to be replaced. AMRAAM effectiveness and accuracy tend to suffer after 10 years even if maintained in storage as prescribed, which may be one of the reasons why even 4-5 C-5 lobbed at IAF Su-30MKI in 2019 failed to hit it."

Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) tender is already facing considerable delays due to which recently France again pushed for repeat orders of another 36 aircraft from India. idrw.org has been told that a few years back, India had agreed to place second orders for 36 jets but now IAF is not keen on it and instead wants to procure another 114 jets under MRFA tender where Rafale will still lead but the tender itself is yet to take off due to complex Transfer of technology (ToT) clauses that are yet to be framed causing delays in the issue of request for proposal (RFP). Dassault Aviation Stalls Indian expansion plans Dassault Aviation awaits the Indian decision to procure a higher stake in the ownership of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) facility at Nagpur, which will be used for assembling Rafale jets in India but the lack of any movement has delayed this. DRAL will continue to manufacture some of the components and panels for the Rafale fighter jets as part of its global supply chain but won’t be made as a second production line out of France until India places firm orders for the jet. Dassault Aviation plans to argument its production facility in France to cater to recent orders that the company has managed to secure from other operators in recent years."

HAL needs to up its PR Game to win orders for LCA-Tejas,https://idrw.org/hal-needs-to-up-its-pr-game-to-win-orders-for-lca-tejas/,"September 15, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG It seems from the various media outlet reports that India’s LCA-Tejas might have missed the contract to supply 18 jets to Malaysia, not because the aircraft was found to be more expensive or failed to meet technical parameters but due to the PR machinery of the Koreans that ensured that jet that failed to meet many parameters was not only popular with the masses but also effective use of lobbying worked to secure orders for them. State-owned HAL over the years has not roped in marketing gurus or lobby groups to swing orders in the aviation sector, if India wants to be among the top 5 global defense exporters then it needs to sell big-ticket items like aircraft and ships but over the year defense PSUs like HAL have not able to up the game. HAL needs to have a dedicated LCA-Tejas team that participates in air shows and defense exhibitions around the world no matter if the country is interested or not in its procurement. Global OEMs often launch new fighter jets and are able to manage enough media hype that the jet that is yet to take make its maiden flight is already well-known in defense aviation. Even though LCA-Tejas has been flying for some years now, the company has not created videos and documentaries to promote it in the export market nor has engaged with any aviation marketing company which will hurt any chances of export prospects. many freelance artists and illusionists are willing to work for the creation of marketing videos and images for the company but yet not one skilled individual has been approached by the company. Like ISRO, HAL should create a new subsidiary that has only job to promote its products in the export market and work like a private organization that is hungry for sales and keen to push its turnover for which it has to take the lead since it now has many products that can do well in the export market but it needs to be marketed well which babus in a government environment simply aren’t capable of doing it.

A deep dive into SLBM’s in Submarine Operations,https://idrw.org/a-deep-dive-into-slbms-in-submarine-operations/,"September 15, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. Ballistic missiles launched from submarines are known as submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Almost all SLBMs have nuclear weapons and are part of the Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces (NSNF), one of the three components of the nuclear triad. Modern ballistic missiles have an intercontinental range, are equipped with multiple warheads with individual targeting, and can simultaneously attack several targets hundreds of kilometres apart. South Koreans have conventional submarines which can launch conventional SLBM with a conventional warhead. North Koreans, too, have this capability, but it is not known if they have a conventional or nuclear warhead. Most submarines can launch a single and a salvo, both from the surface and from the underwater position. After a volley, only a torpedo (and sea mines) remains at the crew’s disposal for anti-ship and submarine application. The submarine is redirected to warships, a sea convoy or an aircraft carrier strike group for protection. If the sub has time to fire all the missiles, the enemy’s missile defense systems will immediately determine its location, and it will most likely be destroyed. Not much is known about how much time it is required to launch an SLBM, but there are references that the Soviet Union had launched three missiles in 12 minutes, not counting the submarine’s ascend, descent and positioning. The SLBM was launched from a Hotel Class / Project 658 nuclear powered submarine carrying marine ballistic missile R-13. R-13 is a single stage liquid fuelled missile. Refuelling of the R-13 was carried out from submarine tanks immediately before the launch. The deeper the launch depth, the better it is for submarine safety from detection. Some navies have equipped their submarines with MANPADS for air defense. A diver can keep the low-flying aircraft at bay while the submarine submerges at a safer depth. Although the missile can be launched from a depth of up to 60m, the launch from an underwater platform is normally carried out from a depth of 20-30m. For example, on September 10, 1960, the Soviet Union launched an SLBM sailing at a depth of 30 meters at a speed of 3.2 knots. Trident II was launched in December 1989 from a depth of 37.5 m. The submarine was moving at a speed of 3-4 knots relative to the water. The absolute speed was zero. When a submarine shoots from under the water, it usually is in motion. The speed is low – only three to five knots, A submarine can launch SLBMs in two methods. The ‘wet launch’ distinguished all Russian liquid SLBMs. However, this method has disadvantages. Filling shafts with water takes time and creates acoustic noise. If a submarine is pursued by an anti-submarine ship, it can locate and destroy it quickly. Solid rockets are good because they can perform a dry launch’. They are fired from the launch tube with a powder charge, and the engine is turned on above the water’s surface. This method is quieter and faster, thanks to which the chances of a successful launch increase dramatically. SLBM launch is challenging in the Arctic, where a submarine trip in itself is associated with significant risk. Nuclear missile carriers do not shoot from under the ice. Shooting missiles from holes is also not possible as large pieces of ice are no better than the packed layer. The effectiveness of firing largely depends on the navigators: the more accurately they determine the boat’s position before launch, the more accurately the missiles will hit. Even a tiny error in the coordinates seriously affects the results. Modern missiles are equipped with an Astro-correction system which is triggered when the warhead goes into space to compensate for these errors. The submerged depth of the submarine is also a part of the survivability of a submarine. Submarines operate in the following depts – periscope depth, test depth, working depth, estimated depth and limited depth. SLBM launches are usually carried out in the periscope depth if launched from underwater. This is usually about 18m, but since newer submarines have started discarding periscopes for cameras, this may change in the future. Test depth is where the submarine can be without restrictions in normal peaceful conditions. It is determined during sea trials of the submarine. According to the requirements of the U.S. Navy, this depth should be two-thirds of the design depth, according to the requirements of the British Navy – 4/7 of the design depth, according to the requirements of the German Navy, about half of the design depth. Working depth or the Operating depth or Maximum operating depth is the maximum depth of a long stay, which does not disrupt the operation of the systems and devices of the submarine. As a rule, it is 80-85% of the maximum immersion depth. Usually, this is about 300 meters. Estimated depth or the design depth is the nominal depth indicated in a submarine’s tactical and technical requirements. Depth limit or the Limiting depth or crush depth is – the maximum depth, immersion to which is not accompanied by residual deformations of the strong hull of the submarine. Some U.S. and Russian nuclear submarines can operate beyond 800 m without experiencing a crush on their hulls. Submarines have no operational roles at this depth and are mostly done for research purposes.

The report also indicates that it is facing some serious competition from the Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) developed FA-50 that has been offered at a relatively lower cost with similar sensor packages. According to an estimate by Janes, LCA-Tejas has been offered at $32 million per unit and FA-50 at $26.5million per unit. Koreans have now offered an off-the-shelf AESA radar and in-flight refueling capability on the aircraft as demanded by the RMAF even though they are yet to be tested out. LCA-Tejas at $32 million is the most expensive jet that is on offer other than the Mig-35 that is unlikely to be cleared by RMAF due to its history with the Mig-29 type. Ex-Kuwaiti F-18 Hornet is on sale and since it is already operated by RMAF that too has emerged as an option but it will be an expensive jet to be used for the Pilot training Malaysia’s FLIT program intends to acquire an initial batch of 18 light combat aircraft as part of the RMAF’s Capability Development 2055 plan in the first batch and another 18 jets in the second batch times in 2025."

IAF operates 17 Il-76MDs that were acquired between 1985-89 and by the turn of this decade, the first three aircraft will be over 45 years old that are still on the older Soloviev D-30KP-1 turbofan engines. IAF had plans to upgrade the Il-76MD fleet with Aviadvigatel PS-90A turbofan engines that are equipped on the 6 Il-78MKI Aerial Refuellers and 3 A-50EI Phalcon airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft in the IAF fleet but that might not happen now as idrw.org has been told plans are being made to start retiring older batch from 2030 onwards.

"How HAL Missed the Trick by NOT Going for Do 328, Do 428, Do 728",https://idrw.org/how-hal-missed-the-trick-by-not-going-for-do-328-do-428-do-728/,"September 7, 2022","SOURCE: JOYDEEP GHOSH / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG It seems HAL missed a trick or 2 by not going in for Do 328, Do 428, and Do 728 family after going in for Do 228. HAL till date has produced more than 125 Do 228s and as now developed H 228 which is the civilian transport certified version of 19-seater Do 228. Logically and ideally speaking HAL should have gone in for the follow on Do 328, Do 428, and Do 728 family. That would have allowed HAL to master and manufacture 30-, 40-, and 60-, 70-seater aircrafts by now for use in the civil aviation market. It would have allowed people across India access to low-cost airline flights on low-cost aircrafts. I won’t go into Do 228 because it is now well known but talk more about the other Dornier aircrafts. Do 228 Do 328 Do 328 is a stretched version of Do 228. First built by Dornier, then Fairchild-Dornier, and now Sierra Nevada Corporation. If HAL had gone for licensed production of Do 328 which is still in production, not only Indian Armed Forces but also regional civilian aircraft market would have benefitted a lot as India literally doesn’t have any 30-seater low-cost aircraft flying in the domestic circuit. Even a jet powered version of the aircraft called the Do 328 JET for a few years that carried the same number of passengers. License production of the aircraft would have been very beneficial for HAL as it would have allowed HAL to gain valuable experience in civil aircraft manufacturing. Do 428 Dornier 428JET was a program undertaken by Fairchild Dornier to develop a 44-seat regional jet aircraft as a stretched version of Do 328 albeit the jet powered version. Its design schematics were ready and even orders were placed but the program was cancelled at the turn of century due to less demand in west. But such an aircraft with turboprop engines can be very beneficial in India as it would have allowed a 44-seater aircraft to connect many small cities and towns in India, Nepal, Bangladesh allowing the people to experience low-cost travel. It also could well have had an export market in Africa and South America. HAL can still try get its hand on the design schematics of the aircraft and modify it as per today’s requirement, that way HAL would have not only gained experience in making a 44-seater but also hold valuable IPR (Intellectual Property Rights). Really it seems HAL missed a trick here. Do 728 Family HAL missed the biggest chance and trick when the Fairchild Dornier 728/928 family which was a series of jet-powered regional airliner being developed was cancelled. The Do 728 family weresupposed to have seatingcapacity between 50 and 110 passengers. All these were stretched version of the existing Do 328JET. The 728/928 wanted to launch the jets by mid-2003 for regional service.A modern design the jet program was cancelled after the insolvency of Fairchild Dornier.The company had developed 3 prototypes Do 528, Do 728, and Do 928 with last one passenger capacity being over 90. These would have very ideal for India civilian region and commuter air traffic, and definitely like the Do 328 and Do 428 definitely have export potential. If HAL somehow got hold of the design schematics and the actual prototypes, after making relevant changes HAL would have got itself a huge stash of invaluable IPRs from these planes. HAL could still get its hand on the designs and work on them towards developing a 70-to-110-seater regional commuter jet/propeller plane, something that is still a pipe dream for India, and we have been chasing it since last 4 decades, but have never been able to get anywhere close to it. NAL SARAS Many people may say those are foreign designs there is nothing indigenous about it. As such working on NAL SARAS is a much better idea. But to me it is like reinventing the wheel when we already have H 228 with 19-seater capacity why waste money and effort on SARAS which is not even a19-seater capacity plane. Also, there is nothing indigenous about it, its’ actually a Russian design from late 1970s that was abandoned just like Do 428/528/728/928. It has P&W engines and many more things imported that has been fitted into it. The best idea is to learn from the experience from NAL SARAS and apply it on the design’s schematics sourced for Do 428/528/728/928. Why did the Indian Armed Forces commit to buy dozens of 14-seaters SARAS (though SARAS MK2 is 19-seater) when they already operate the Do 228 is beyond my understanding. I just hope that better sense prevails and HAL still makes all-out effort to grab the design schematics of Do 428/528/728/928 and work on them to develop a regional jet/propeller plane besides going in for the licensed production of the Do 328 (jet/propeller) design as a follow on of Do 228 aircraft.

"India Needs 4 Aircraft Carriers,150 TEDBF & 26 Rafale-M",https://idrw.org/india-needs-4-aircraft-carriers150-tedbf-26-rafale-m/,"September 5, 2022","SOURCE: JOYDEEP GHOSH / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Couple of days back the new INS Vikrant was commissioned into the Indian Navy. As with the prevalent practice, Indian Navy named its new aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, thus bringing back the name that was lost when original INS Vikrant was decommissioned in 1997. Now everyone is talking about whether Indian Navy should go for a bigger and costly 3rd aircraft carrier or look to setup a low-cost island based fixed aircraft carriers like the idea floated by late CDS Gen Bipin Rawat. My assertion is that we not only need at least 2 low-cost island based fixed aircraft carriers but, also, we need 4 floating aircraft carriers. India needs 4 aircraft carriers conventionally powered (for now), out of which 2 need to be of INS Vikrant class and other 2 of INS Vikramaditya class. While INS Vikrant class carries 12-14 fixed wing jets and 14helos each (6 or 7 SAR, 4 ASW, 3 AEW), the INS Vikramaditya class carries 16-18 fixed wing jets and 16 helos each (6 or 8 SAR, 5 ASW, 3 AEW). Please note I am not going by Wikipedia figures but on calculation of 1000 ton for per aircraft/helo and 10000-to-12000-ton supplies that each carrier loads up with on each trip, excluding the fuel and ammunition supplies. 1st carrier takes care of western seaboard, 2nd carrier takes care of eastern seaboard, 3rd carrier in repairs and 4th carrier takes care of remaining part of Northern Indian Ocean left untouched by the 2 carriers and the entire Southern Indian Ocean. Southern Indian Ocean is a massive fish, oil, gas, and mineral rich area. Do note China has already forayed into this area and is practically robbing the fish in the area with huge fishing trawlers. b. Note that 12 fixed wing jet each on 2 INS Vikrant class carriers and 16 fixed wing jet on 2 INS Vikramaditya class carriers adds to 56, almost the exact number of 57 the Navy wanted originally while selecting a replacement for44 Mig 29K/KUB. Another point to be noted is that we have design schematics of both INS Vikrant class carriers and INS Vikramaditya class carriers (if we didn’t have access to design schematics of Vikramaditya, we surely couldn’t have suggested changes for complete redesign of the carrier as per our need). So, it will be much easier to build another 40000-ton INS Vikrant class carrier (renamed INS Viraat after the 2nd decommissioned carrier) and 2nd 45000-ton INS Vikramaditya class carrier. It will help amortize the project investment made in training personnel, setting up machines and more. c. Building a 3rd aircraft carrier of just 65000-tonwon’t make sense if its’ not fully capable, meaning it must have a single fuel lifetime nuclear reactor, should be able to carry and launch 3 E2D Hawkeye type aircraft, as well as launch at least 40 fully armed and fueled fixed wing fighters, with 12 to 15 helos. All this can’t be accommodated in 65000-ton carrier, it must be atleast75000-ton carrier same as what France is building to replace the Charles de Gaulle carrier. India still can’t build a single fuel lifetime nuclear reactor; the nuclear reactors being designed for future 6 SSNs &3 S5-class SSBNs are still in concept and no sign yet that these will be single fuel lifetime nuclear reactor. Even if built, that reactor will have to be re-modelled for carrier. All this will be at least 15 years’ time give or take and is highly cost prohibitive, in the meantime CSL can easily build another 40000-ton INS Vikrant class carrier and 2nd 45000-ton INS Vikramaditya class carrier. d. Many may say we need a 3rd nuclear powered aircraft carrierthat can help launch fully armed and fueled fixed wing fighterjets. However even with conventionally powered aircraft carriers, it is possible. Fighters’ jets can launch with full weapons load and 50% fuel load. Midair they can be refueled by buddy-buddy refueling or with an unmanned refueler UAV. This way even conventionally powered aircraft carriers can operate and launch fully armed and fueled fixed wing fighters. e. A low-cost island based full-fledged fixed aircraft carriers like the idea floated by late CDS Gen Bipin Rawat, is a good idea. 1st in Andaman Islands and 2nd in Lakshadweep islands. Many may say we already have them, but please note those are IAF bases operating Su30MKIs or Mig 29s both of which are owned by IAF and operated by IAF pilots except for the 12 Jaguar IMs that are owned by IAF operated by IAF pilots but are under command of Indian Navy. What is needed is a full-fledged fixed aircraft carriers or naval air base that operates not just Mig 29K, TEDBF, but also E2D Hawkeye, P8Is. It must also be protected from natural calamities like cyclone or tsunami. Also, the island based full-fledged fixed aircraft carriers can be used to launch 24 fully armed Tu22M3s (12 on each base). Do note,just as Russia is restarting Tu160 production line, there is good chance it may restart Tu22M3 production line as well, if that happens then India must buy 24 of them. Leasing them is not an option, as leased platforms can’t be used in war. Tu22M3 with their 7000 km range armed with cruise missiles can launch serious land attacks both on eastern and western side. f. Indian Navy must take delivery of 150 TEDBFs at least, because otherwise will be impossible to amortize the project. Do note TEDBF is not LCA MK2 with an extra engine, it’s a completely new design. As such a new production line, new HR training, new machinery, new validation process of system, and new certification process has to be followed to take TEDBF which is still in concept state to LSP/SP levels. Yet how TEDBF will be amortized for all the investment made in the project is difficult to figure. While 56-60 TEDBF are expected to fly from 2 Vikrant class and 2 Vikramaditya class carriers, if these 4 carriers are ultimately chosen, 25 will stay at INS Hansa for training, while 25 each will fly off from the 2 fixed base aircraft carriers as mentioned earlier. That way 15 jets can remain in reserve, but will that help amortize the project??Do note at least 400 LCA MK1/MK1A/MK2 will need to be built to amortize the project; much like the same way 450/500 Arjun MK1/Arjun MK1A/Arjun MK2 need to be built to amortize the project. Right from the stage of concept to reality, TEDBF is not expected to come up in good numbers before 2038, to replace the Mig 29K/KUB or Rafale M/FA18. g. If26 Rafale M or FA18 are to be chosen, it will be chosen for INS Vikrant, out of which 10-12 will remain in INS Hansa (it has SBTF) for training while other 12-14 will fly from INS Vikrant, while the INS Vikramaditya will be reserved for Mig29K/KUB till TEDBF arrives to replace the fighter jet complement of the 2 carriers. It is now being revealed that that the lift size of INS Vikrant or INS Vikramaditya, can’t accommodate Rafale M as they don’t fold wings; whereas FA18 can not only be accommodated in the lift of 2 aircraft carriers but also it can easily communicate with P8Is and MH60R. So, in all likelihood FA18 might be chosen, but what will happen to the 26 FA18 when TEDBFs arrive by 2035 or 2038? These 26 FA 18 will become surplus and headache for Indian Navy. On the other hand, if Rafale M are chosen, even when TEDBF arrives these won’t be surplus, these can easily be used by IAF, as reportedly Rafale AF or Rafale C and Rafale M are 95% same minus tailhooks. Do note that RFQ for 114 MRFA is still not released and if IAF was really interested, it would have done that by now. IAF is probably thinking that going the G2G way for 114 Rafale will be best option. If that is done, then may be Dassault may well help develop a mechanism to enable Rafale M to fit into the lift of INS Vikrant. Lets’ see if better sense prevails and India goes for 4 Aircraft Carriers, 150 TEDBF & 26 Rafale-M.

Understanding China’s Ongoing Defence Projects & How India’s Future Tech Will Be The Gamechanger,https://idrw.org/understanding-chinas-ongoing-defence-projects-how-indias-future-tech-will-be-the-gamechanger/,"September 6, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. China is working on several futuristic projects to develop a modern and highly effective air force. The PLA Air Force received the first 5th generation fighter of Chinese design a few years ago. Data indicates that China started developing its fifth generation of fighters in the late 1990s. The initial experiments and theoretical research took several years. A full-fledged project began to develop the 5th Generation fighter in the middle of the following decade. The project was undertaken by the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (CAIG) and was given the codename J-20 (after the 20th century). In January 2011, the J-20 prototype made its maiden flight. It helped China become the third nation in the world to design and operate a new breed of fighters. The following few years were devoted to testing, other tasks, and getting ready for mass production. According to various sources, the fighter has reportedly undergone several different changes at this point. The engines were changed, various onboard equipment components were added and tested, etc. Mass production began in 2016, and the first production planes were handed over to the air force’s training wing at the end of the year. The PLA Air Force formally inducted the new J-20 in March 2017. A full-scale deployment of the fighter in combat units started a year later. Data available indicates that CAIG has produced 50–70 J-20 aircraft. New aircraft are frequently delivered to the units as production continues. They currently serve in the eastern theatre, protecting the nation’s coast and resolving issues at sea. Reports from the US indicate that the J-20 have met the US F-35s in the South China Sea. The J-20 fighter has given not only China new military capabilities but also something to be proud of. It demonstrated the Chinese industry’s capacity to produce the newest aircraft models. The PLA lags behind the US and Russia in the fifth generation technologies but has managed to create and deploy the aircraft ahead of the Russians. Continued Development Data currently available indicate that CAIG continues to develop the J-20 project. Chinese media sources have previously mentioned efforts to replace the avionics and install new engines. Removing “teething troubles” is probably one of these improvements, but an entire aircraft upgrade aimed at enhancing its performance and potential is also conceivable. CAIG has now produced a two-seat version of the J-20. The J-20B prototype aircraft was constructed and put through testing last fall. It was first observed at the airport in October, and the first flight happened in November. The second prototype began participating in the flight tests in February 2022. A two-seat version J-20B is a fighter modified for combat training and probably ground attack. This aircraft might have more developed and advanced avionics and unique operational and combat capabilities. J-20B is expected to be better equipped to coordinate with other combat units, such as aircraft and UAVs, and to gather and process information. It can be made as a tactical air command post. The duration of the tests on the two J-20Bs currently in operation is unknown. The updated J-20 has also become a source of pride, much like the original model. The new J-20B is the only example of its kind and is the first fifth-generation fighter in the world to feature a two-seat cockpit. FC-31 or J-31 The first information on creating a second Chinese next-generation fighter surfaced in 2010–2011. The new project’s specifications were displayed at exhibitions. The project, which went by the working names FC-31 or J-31, is being developed by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). SAC constructed the first prototype aircraft in the fall of 2012 and made its first flight at the end of October. The aircraft was repeatedly observed in the sky, indicating an extensive test campaign. Different flight modes were used, and equipment and weapon usage training was conducted. However, the aircraft did not go into production after years of testing. FC-31 nevertheless assisted the Chinese industry in analysing the new technological model and testing various solutions for this undertaking.In addition, it helped China develop and fly two fifth-generation fighters, making it the second nation in the world to do so. Naturally, it is a factor when rejecting mass production and use. J-35 Project It was revealed in 2020 that the Chinese were creating a deck upgrade for the FC-31, which was given the moniker J-35. A prototype or prototype of the aircraft was spotted at one of the PLA Navy’s experimental sites about a year ago, and flight tests started in the fall.In late October, the J-35 made its first known flight from an airfield. It appears that J-35 will undergo comprehensive testing for some time. The aircraft must first demonstrate its capabilities at a land airfield before going through checks on one of the active aircraft carriers. The new fighter will be able to join the Navy’s fleet no earlier than the middle of the decade if there are no major obstacles. It will initially replace and supplement the J-15 aircraft currently in service. There are currently two aircraft carriers in the PLA fleet. The fourth is scheduled to begin construction; the third, called Fujian, was just recently launched. Fujian, which is currently being finished, may serve as the foundation for the J-35 fighter, according to various estimates. This aircraft carrier can launch various aircraft types thanks to its flat flight deck and three launch positions with electromagnetic catapults. The J-35 project is of great importance for developing the fleet and prestige. If this project is successful, China will become the second country in the world to create its 5th generation carrier-based fighter – and again close the gap with the United States.

India to start testing new steel for Nuclear attack submarine program,https://idrw.org/india-to-start-testing-new-steel-for-nuclear-attack-submarine-program/,"September 5, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP), the flagship unit of the country’s largest steel maker Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has developed a variant of the steel that was used on the construction of the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier that will ultimately be used in the development of the indigenous nuclear attack submarine program. A team from Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) and the Indian Navy will be visiting the facility to inspect the testing facility that has been newly developed to commence testing of the new grade of steel. Initially, steel plates developed will go through a series of stress and other testing parameters later small sections of the hull often called mock-up sections are developed to test welding specifications that have been finalized and laser scanners are used to see any anomaly or welding failure. Nuclear attack submarines are required to have noise reduction as a fundamental driving parameter of their design to keep their ambient low-frequency noise levels on the lower side for which the grade of steel and the welding process used determines the maximum operating depth of the submarine and its average ambient low-frequency noise levels. The SSBNs have a different primary function than SSN fast attack submarines and need different design features as the well different grades of steel in some sections. India is planning new technologies such as pump-jet propulsion and high-temperature, gas-cooled nuclear reactors for its nuclear attack submarine fleet to keep them sufficiently quiet to be militarily effective. Indian Navy is targeting to have 95% indigenous content in the nuclear attack submarine that is under the design phase for which it has set in motion the process for the development of next-gen technology submarine technology with public-private sector companies. Indian Navy plans to field six next-gen nuclear attack submarines from 2035 onwards."

F/A-18F Super Hornet seems to be a clear winner for the Indian Navy’s tender for 26 MRCBFs under which it requires eight twin-seat aircraft and 18 single-seat aircraft because Rafale M doesn’t have twin-seater and unfoldable wings mean it simply can’t be taken to lower decks for repairs or maintenance. Boeing has promised that it can supply 2 Super Hornets per month after a gap of 36 months after the contract is concluded and a whole lot of 26 jets in just over 13-14 months. TEDBF program that is made keeping INS Vikrant is still a long way before it matures. ADA has promised the first flight in 2026 and production in 2031 which is way too ambitious for the program considering how slow the LCA- Navy Mk1 program was. 2035 production timeline could be a realistic timeline for HAL to start delivering TEDBF to the Navy and another 4 years to fully replace the Mig-29K fleet of 40+ jets.

INS Vikrant has two SAC lift with dimensions of 10M(W) x 14M(L) that are perfectly fine to operate Mig-29K and LCA-Navy that the Indian Navy originally had in mind when Vikrant was under development but it will be close call for the F-18 E/F Super hornet that is 18.38M(L) and 9.93M(W) with folded wings but the aircraft width does manage to fall just short of 10M mark and it should be able to scrape through it. But Rafale M has a wingspan of 10.90M which is 0.90M more than what two SAC lifts onboard INS Vikrant can accommodate, Rafale M doesn’t have foldable wings which could make it near impossible for it to operate from two SAC lifts that are installed on the INS Vikrant unless Dassault Rafale M is offered with wings that can be folded or modified to be shorter. Indian Navy’s future deck-based indigenous Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter (TEDBF) has a wingspan of 11.2M but after it is folded it becomes 7.6M that can be easily accommodated on those lifts."

Tu-160: Leasing of Hangar Queens will be disastrous for the Indian Military,https://idrw.org/tu-160-leasing-of-hangar-queens-will-be-disastrous-for-the-indian-military/,"August 28, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Soviet-era long-range bombers like Tu-95 Bears, Tu-22M Backfires, and Tu-160 Blackjacks are old and, at times, questionably maintained and have all experienced maintenance issues of some sort post fall of the Soviet Union. Yet they are reports that India might be considering leasing six Tu-160 Blackjacks from Russia to reinforce its second-strike nuclear capability. At first Russian Air Force inventory has only 17 Soviet-built Tu-160s still in service, the latest one was the Tu-160M2 which was made from the unused airframe that was lying after the fall of the Soviet Union but Russia plans to eventually buy more about 50 Tu-160M bombers and is upgrading 16 existing Tu-160s to the standard first one to come in 2023. Russia likely will follow its old playbook and offer older Tu-160s to India after modernization with limited airframe life left in them as they do with their leased nuclear submarine to India so that once the lease is over they are scrapped or kept in storage since they will have little utility for them after the lease period is over. keeping in mind the advanced age of this aircraft it will end up more of a Hangar Queen than having any actual utility. Past Blunders Indian Navy operated Tupolev Tu-142 an aircraft derived from the Tu-95 turboprop strategic bomber in past and very well knows a thing or two about how cumbersome are this soviet era jets to operate and maintain that in 29 years fleet of 8 aircraft accumulated only 30,000 flight hours at the time of retirement when compared to P-8I fleet that has already surpassed 35,000 flight hours in less than 10 years. Indian Naval Arm a few years back had made plans to lease 4 Tu-22M a supersonic, variable-sweep wing, long-range strategic and maritime strike bomber but the overhaul cost of modernization of this aircraft and operation +flight hour cost was a major reason why the deal fell through and since then Navy has rejected the idea of ever acquiring a maritime strike bomber for its operations requirements. Indian Air force doesn’t need a long-range strategic bomber, especially one that is not fully owned by them and comes with various No can do clauses that will further limit its usage in an operational role. Su-30MKI should be utilized for long-range strike missions that it needs to be equipped with a long-range cruise or hypersonic missile weapon system. India in long run can work on a stealth 6th generation fighter bomber that can be used for Nuclear delivery or long-range maritime strikes by both the Navy and Airforce.

‘War Threatens Ukrainian Component Supply for Tejas; HAL On The Hunt for Indigenous Replacement,https://idrw.org/war-threatens-ukrainian-component-supply-for-tejas-hal-on-the-hunt-for-indigenous-replacement/,"August 27, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. The Russian incursion into Ukraine has been a global spectacle. Since February, the world order and the global supply chains, already marred by Covid-19, continue to suffer. In fact, as the European wheat bowl fights for its sovereignty, a global recession is setting. So, after commodities, economies and lives, the latest impact is being felt at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). HAL’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas imported an essential component from Ukraine. While the stock could sail HAL through the initial disruption, the sustained conflict requires HAL to innovate a solution. Valorous: LCA Tejas Designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) in collaboration with the Aircraft Research and Design Centre (ARDC) of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), HAL Tejas is a single engine, delta wing, light multirole fighter. A product of the LCA programme that aimed at a replacement for the MiG-21 initially. LCA Tejas has been riding on a wave of success. After replacing the MiG-21 of the Flying Daggers squadron of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2016, the IAF has placed an order for more. In total, the IAF seeks to procure over 300 LCA Tejas. This will be a mix of the three variants on offer: Tejas Mark 1, Tejas Mark 1A (the export variant) and the trainer aircraft. And now, reports are coming in about HAL securing the export deal for the Tejas to the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF). More than technical innovation, the LCA Tejas embodies the policies of India, a true friend to the world. Indian policy, globally, has been to engage all sides. Hence, India has been using a mix of NATO and Russian equipment across the ranks and files of the armed forces. The LCA Tejas takes a cue from this and allows for integration with both kinds of weaponry and gadgetry. This has also been a factor in RMAF’s decision since Malaysia strives to balance its global policies. Chink in the Armour: The Elusive HP-30 A fighter jet has millions of components. The engine alone may have more than 30,000 components. One of the components crucial to its operation is a hydraulic pump. Hydraulics refers to a mechanical function that operates through the force of liquid pressure. If you have ever sat on a barber’s chair that seems to lift you with only a minor foot motion, you have witnessed a hydraulic pump. In aviation, hydraulics mechanisms are used to operate the control panels. LCA Tejas is equipped with a digital fly-by-wire that ditches an intricate system of pulleys for a digital computer network that signals a hydraulic mechanism at its terminal end to execute a motion when triggered. For example, when the pilot makes the left turn, the controller’s mechanical action is converted to a digital signal that travels to a computer. The computer then sends the digital signal to the ailerons on either side to simultaneously move up and down and steer the jet left. Knowing how crucial hydraulics are to the Tejas, it is easier to grasp the gravity of the disruption caused by the unavailability of the HP-30 hydraulic pump imported from State Enterprise, Ukraine. HP-30 was used in rotary pumping, servo, pressure compensator, and short sill mechanisms of the LCA Tejas.Given such a challenge, HAL is working towards indigenizing HP-30’s replacement. Swift innovation and integration of an indigenous component will not only take the percentage of indigenization higher but also bolster the goal of AatmaNirbhar (self-reliance).

DRDO and Private sector company Larsen & Toubro earlier this year were given in-principle approval for the development of a light tank for the Indian Army. Indian Army which is looking to sharpen its mountain warfare firepower had asked DRDO to take the program on mission mode looking at the urgency of the requirements. Indian Army plans to procure around 350 25-tonne light tanks under the Make in India initiative that can operate in high-altitude areas, and marginal terrains to the island territories and will be highly transportable for rapid deployment to meet any operational situation.

Dassault Rafale has offered its Rafale F4-1 standard to India and might be seen in the driver seat due to past orders of 36 Rafale F3R fighter jets that it got from India but the Eurofighter consortium bid might stage an upset. Eurofighter Tranche 5 combat aircraft is what will be offered by the Eurofighter consortium when IAF issues RFP and has plans to undercut Rafale F4-1 offer by Dassault in terms of fly-away cost which could put India and Dassault in a peculiar situation that might force Dassault to undercut its price more. idrw.org has been told by Industrial sources that the Eurofighter consortium bid will see near 30% less than Dassault which might kick start a bidding war in India if the terms and conditions of the MRFA remain the same as the now canceled tender of the MRCA. Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter were the only two combat aircraft that had cleared Technical rounds before price bids were opened. Eurofighter consortium is quite confident that it will clear the technical bid but expects some challenges from the F-15EX Eagle II bid by Boeing but is expecting that there will be only the last two standing at the end and the winner will be decided by the cost of each aircraft that will be made in India rather than Political considerations that might influence the decision.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the American foreign intelligence service, recently carried out a drone strike against Al-Zawahiri, the Al Qaeda chief and one of the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks of 2001. The regime of Taliban 2.0 became a testament to the American agencies’ abilities to not only track but also eliminate any targets in Afghanistan. The strike garnered much fanfare also due to the rumoured Hellfire R9X missile that is meant to address the “left seat, right seat” problem. However, gathering and verifying actionable intel is critical in an intelligence operation. How exactly did the CIA track Al-Zawahiri? Dead Man Walking: Who was Al-Zawahiri? As per the US, Ayman Al-Zawahiri was Osama bin Laden’s second in command during the 9/11 attacks.And he took over as the head of Al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden’s death. Then, the US put a $25 millionbounty on his head. Zawahiri was a 71 years old Egyptian-born physician. He was added to the list ofUnited Nations sanctions in 1999. The location of his safe house is reportedly precisely where the American Embassy used to be. Selling Sovereignty: Pakistan is the Eye of the Perfect StormSince 1947, Pakistan has been living on the aid given by the US. Between 1951 and 2017, over $60 billionwas pumped into Pakistan by the US. The de facto establishment of Pakistan, and its military services,has had many high-ranking officials retire to lavish properties in the US or Europe. Even the kids of suchofficials live and study in such first-world countries. The highest level of this open loot on the Pakistanipublic was when the National Security Advisor, Moeed Yusuf, was, in fact, a US citizen. Even though the US denied the ousted Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s allegations of American involvementin his removal, Pakistani Army General Bajwa was quick to damage control by issuing marinated lines tothe press. The Pakistani elite have essentially rendered Pakistan a vassal for the US. Just recently, in the face of grave economic collapse in Pakistan, General Bajwa urged the US to fast-track an IMF loan for the country. The Weakest Link: Biden’s Troubles at Home from a Trip Aboard In the larger context of geopolitics, it is clear that the Americans wish to continue their aggressive frontagainst Russia. In the ensuing energy crisis, the US has been able to secure an alternative to its domesticsupply through Saudi Arabia. But this energy security compromises any wishes of pinning Saudi PrinceMohammed bin Salman for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The recent trip to Saudi Arabia has been akin to stepping around the broken glass for Joe Biden. Notonly was he unable to bring up the issue, but his projected bonhomie also enraged the human rightscommunity back home in the US. Joe Biden’s failures now form a long list, including the inability to secure the release of political prisonerslike the cousin of Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, a sympathiser of the US.Biden also could not cease the offensive support to aid the Saudi attack in Yemen. A series of losses for Biden drastically impacted his approval ratings amongst his voter base. LikePresident, like Vice President. Just as Obama’s tenure oversaw Osama’s elimination, Biden rushed toassassinate the second-in-command. Hail Mary: CIA Doing Biden’s BiddingAfghanistan is a landlocked country. For the US to fly into Afghanistan means through the airspace ofanother country that borders it. In the west, Iran obviously could not be a way in given the US-Iranrelations. If they did try nonetheless, Iran has Surface to Air Missiles that would have taken down the USdrone. To the north of Afghanistan are the Central Asian countries whose allegiance still lies with Russia.So, any activity in that region would tip off Russia and China. Both of these will also be quick to shootdown the drone. By elimination, only one country bordering Afghanistan could have provided access to the US: Pakistan,its vassal state. The US now has military bases in Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, Oman,Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. However, with a flight range of 1500 km limit for any drone, it would beimpossible to complete the journey with just airspace clearances. It had to be launched from Pakistani soil to achieve the objective. The Taliban’s lack of an air defence system is known. So, most likely, theyused a Pakistani air base closest to Kabul. While most likely the CIA had been able to narrow down the location of Al-Zawahiri to somewherebetween the Pakistani and Afghani border, Pakistan’s dire economic need allowed the CIA to arm-twistISI and Pakistani Army into not only sharing precise information but also lend its military bases to launchthe drones. After the strike, the IMF declared that Pakistan would receive the aid it wanted. Though the IMF will stillenforce its strict measures, the aid to be released by the end of August would only be the firstinstallment, with more on the way. The first take away from this episode is that the US has worked hard to create modern, situationalcolonies globally, such as Pakistan in the South Asia region. It has also been engaging Ukraine and itsneighbours similarly to counter Russia. The second takeaway is that contrary to the mainstream narrative, the various terror organizations likethe Taliban, ISIS and Al Qaeda are cooperative and collaborative. Otherwise, it would have beenimpossible for an Al Qaeda chief to reside in Kabul without the knowledge of the Taliban. And in cahootswith all the harbingers of evil is the institutional evil, Pakistan, who effectively sold their sovereignty andthe information in exchange for supporting this strike.+ Disclaimer : Articles published under ” MY TAKE ” are articles written by Guest Writers and Opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Russia has confirmed that the delays were largely attributed to design changes but didn’t clarify if design changes carried out were of a major order. Su-75, a single engine 5th gen stealth fighter jet developed for the export market to compete with the American F-35 was first revealed at the MAKS Airshow in 2021 and originally planned for the first flight in 2023. Russia plans to manufacture four prototypes of the Su-75 that will be used for developmental trials and has confirmed that it will be offered to close allies first. Russia has identified India, Vietnam, UAE, and some Middle-eastern countries that will be among the first countries that will be offered this jet when it is ready for production by mid-2027 or early 2028. Russia still claims that the unit cost of the Su-75 will be $30 million and will be customizable as per the request of the export customers. Su-75 is Russia’s second fifth-generation fighter jet that it plans to develop after the completion of the Su-57 program. India had walked out of the Joint development of the FGFA program which was an Indian-specific variant of the 5th gen fighter jet to be based on the base Su-57 due to various disagreements.

Jet-powered UAVs are more efficient at operating at higher altitudes and can cruise at an altitude of 50,000ft which would put them out of the range of typical anti-aircraft firepower for up to 24 hours. As stated by HAL, HTFE-25 can support Manned or Unmanned platforms that have a Maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 5,000 kg and jet-powered HALE UAVs have an advantage over Turboprop engine-powered drones not only in speed but also in cruise altitudes that it can fly. Indian Air Force not so long ago was considering procuring General Atomics developed MQ-20 Avenger combat drone powered by a turbofan engine but the deal never went through as Pentagon and US Government were not keen on the Transfer of Technology that was demanded by India back then. HAL is developing Combat Air Teaming System [CATS] Warrior as part of the Loyal wingman program but it has MTOW of just 1300 kg that will be powered by a Twin PTA7E turbojet engine generating 3.73 kN of thrust each which won’t be good enough to carry heavy payloads nor provide endurance. 25kN turbofan engine could be an ideal mid-tier unmanned combat platform that can fit in between HAL Warrior and DRDO-developed Ghatak UCAV.

Powering the Navy on the High Seas: GE Marine Engine Star of INS Vikrant,https://idrw.org/powering-the-navy-on-the-high-seas-ge-marine-engine-star-of-ins-vikrant/,"August 17, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. Named after the first Indian aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant was commissioned on the 76th Independence Day. Built at an overall cost of nearly Rs 20,000 crore under a contract between the defence ministry and the Cochin shipyard, the project progressed in three phases ending in May 2007, December 2014 and October 2019, respectively. Its keel was laid in February 2009. Entering the Elite Club of Indigenous Aircraft Carriers Powered by GE Marine’s four LM2500 engines producing 88 MW, give it a maximum speed of 28 knots. INS Vikrant is a testament to the success of the Indian Government’s “Make In India” initiative, as 76 per cent of the content is indigenous. Now, India joins a select group of countries like the US, UK, China and France that could build their indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC). Until now, India imported aircraft carriers. In 2007, the IAC project started. Eventually, it was announced that GE Marine had been selected to provide the power unit, and for this task, GE Marine entrusted the LM2500 marine gas turbines. For the INS Vikrant, the LM2500 was to be built by the Indian public sector company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), in partnership with GE. The 262-metre-long carrier has 14 decks, can accommodate a crew of 1,700, and can operate 30 aircraft. A high degree of automation for machinery operations, navigation and survivability has been built into the INS Vikrant. It can also accommodate a combination of aircraft: fixed-wing and rotary. The ship’s air wing can accommodate 30 aircraft, including the Mig-29K combat aircraft, Kamov-31, MH-60R multi-role helicopter, indigenous Advanced Light Helicopter and the Light Combat Aircraft. The aircraft carrier uses Short Take-Off but Arrested Landing (STOBAR) aircraft-operation mode. For this, the aircraft is launched using a ski-jump take-off strip visually recognised as the narrow, slanting tarmac to one side of the carrier. While landing on a shorter runway, the carrier uses special metallic wires that the aircraft hooks and these arrester wires tighten to bring the aircraft to a halt swiftly. In case of an issue in landing, the pilot speeds up and takes off again to circle back and try landing again. The Vikrant underwent four phases of sea trials of significant equipment and systems between August 2021 and July 2022. Star Performer: LM2500 Gas Turbine For over 30 years, GE has worked with HAL, which assembles, inspects, and tests all LM2500 gas turbines built for the Indian Navy. The LM2500 gas turbine kits were manufactured at GE’s Evendale, Ohio, USA facility and assembled and tested by HAL’s Industrial & Marine Gas Turbine Division in Bangalore, India. HAL is one of the world’s leading aerospace companies manufacturing and maintaining aircraft, helicopters, avionics and aerospace defence equipment. GE Marine has been a faithful companion to the Indian Navy. It has provided the Navy with eighteen engines which are in service. And this relationship is bound to be stronger as it will be offered additional power units for the Project 17A ship. With the world’s most market-dominant gas turbine from GE, the Indian Navy and 39 other navies have worldwide support, whether onshore or at sea, and interoperability benefits with other allied ships. An accurate picture of the GE engines’ success is that it powers 95% of the commissioned gas turbines in the US Navy fleet. Worldwide, GE gas turbines are found in 633 naval ships. With the LM2500’s outstanding track record of being ready for the fight and its ease of maintenance and global support, the LM2500 continues to be the gas turbine of choice of the world’s navies.

Rafale vs F-35: It’s important to move from Unit cost and focus on operating costs,https://idrw.org/rafale-vs-f-35-its-important-to-move-from-unit-cost-and-focus-on-operating-costs/,"August 16, 2022","SOURCE: KR RAMESH KUMAR / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Definition of operating and support (O&S) cost per flying hour (CPFH) seems to be never the focus of most of the debates that place in the Indian defense community sphere when it comes to the procurement of the fighter jets for the Indian Air Force. Often the Low unit cost of F-35A which is now around $78 Million is used to close an argument why India should consider it over French Rafale fighter jets that India previously had procured for nearly $115 million per unit. CPFH is calculated as an aircraft fleet’s operating and support costs divided by its flying hours. CPFH is made of six factors so it can vary from air force to air force for the same jets with the same specifications. Rafale CPFH in India might be a lot cheaper than Rafale CPFH in Qatar because of the factors in the calculation of the CPFH in the manpower hours spend on each aircraft to keep them running and depending on the money that is spent on salaries and other remuneration paid by each air force to their engineers and technicians will ultimately contribute to the CPFH. CPFH of F-35A is around $33,000 per flight hour which Lockheed Martin claims will come down to $30,000 per flight hour by the fiscal year 2023 but the issues with regular false alarms by the Autonomic Logistics Information System on the aircraft have only prolonged the downtime of the aircraft but Lockheed plans to fix it and claims to be working to reduce CPFH of the aircraft to around $25,000 per flight hour by end of 2025. CPFH of Rafale is estimated to be around $18,000 to $21,000 per flight hour, Unlike Lockheed, Dassault has not been forthcoming in giving details of CPFH of Rafale which is why the price range varies but since it is a 4.5gen fighter jet it is expected to have lower CPFH when compared to the 5th Gen F-35. But even if we calculate at the highest CPFH for Rafale then per flight hour cost of Rafale will still be $12,000 cheaper than the current CPFH of the F-35A. But here is what could be a problem for Rafale in 2025 if F-35A can bring down its CPFH to $25,000 per flight hour in 2025 then the difference between both jets will come down to just $4,000 per flight when calculated for 300 average flight hours each aircraft might put each year. CPFH difference will be just over $1.2 million per aircraft which will offset the expensive price tag that Rafale carries in the long run since Lockheed still wants to be cheaper than its current price tag by 2025 when it has sorted its issues with supply chain and its production output increases. Dassault has been winning orders of late for its Rafale fighter jets but the production rate will barely touch 36 aircraft per year by 2025 which is only to cater to a backlog of orders that it has recently won. It’s not clear if Indian Made Rafale will cost less and how much per year it will manage to produce to meet 114 jets requirements for the IAF. But going by the experience of Made in India Sukhoi-30MKI that HAL had produced at a 30% higher cost, Rafale Made in India might see a marginal jump in its unit cost even if it is carried out by a local private sector company.

Some wanted to talk about the conditions of Indian Muslims and others wanted to get assets that are in Jail or facing serious cases in India to be given clean shot so that they can continue their coordinated attacks on the Indian democracy. While most of the western media’s so-called oped concentrated on attacking the present-day Government led by PM Modi, Foreign Policy decides to go after the Indian Armed forces. Foreign Policy wanted Indian security aid to be linked to Indian Armed forces operations so that Human rights violations can be prevented in areas like Kashmir and the Northeast. The article called for U.S. lawmakers to ensure that the Indian military does not commit further human rights violations suggesting it becomes a Big Brother of the Indian Armed Forces and the Indian military should be held to the same standards to which the United States holds its other security partners. It is not clear what Security Aid Foreign Policy was talking about, since the sale of weapons to India under direct Government to Government deals were all paid by the Indian Taxpayers, unlike Pakistan where weapons were transferred to fight the war in Afghanistan which was majority funded by the American taxpayers. Indian Armed forces have no obligation to listen to US Lawmakers and if they want to curb the transfer of weapons to India then India has plenty of options and partners who can supply them to India. One thing foreign Policy got right was that it is indeed the United States that is bending over backward to enhance U.S.-India ties so the Indian Armed Forces have no obligations to act like Lieutenant of the US Armed forces in the region. India can very well manage its own security needs and not fall for carrot and stick methods that are often used by the American deep state to keep countries in line. India already has shown that it has a foreign policy that is independent when it comes to Russia and India will continue to restrict allowing Woke Cancel culture to dictate terms of security alliance with the United States.

DRDO’s Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) which was in charge of the development of the indigenous Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar has successfully concluded the program with major objectives of the program being achieved along with the completion of developmental trials with that program now moves towards production and development of derivates that will be used for indigenously developed fighter jet programs. LRDE has confirmed that Uttam AESA radar is 95% indigenous, with only one imported subsystem that has a search range of over 100km and can track a range of 50 targets with the ability to engage 4 targets at once. Uttam Mk1 will be seen from 20th Tejas Mark IA fighter jet and will have 780 Transmitter and Receiver Modules (TRM). LRDE already has manufactured a second derivate of the AESA radar to be used on the Tejas MkII program that will have 992 Transmitter and Receiver Modules (TRM) and will be the first to feature the groundbreaking antenna technology that will be mounted on a swashplate rotating repositioner that makes it possible to have a higher degree of search volume and a higher degree of look-angle around the nose of the aircraft. LRDE-HAL is carrying out studies to develop a new scaled-up antenna that will be used with a more powerful power supply unit to be used on the Su-30MKI jets. IAF already has accepted the technical feasibility study proposal for the development of a new derivate for the Su-30MKI program and after approvals, LRDE-HAL is carrying out detailed technical studies that will ultimately lead to the development of a new derivate of the indigenously developed active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with higher Transmitter and Receiver Modules (TRM). For the 5th Generation AMCA program, LRDE is moving away from the present solid-state gallium arsenide (GaAs) technology to the latest Gallium Nitride (GaN) based technology that comes with superior heat dispersion for better cooling of the radar thus ensuring increased performance.

With Buzz around Strategic bomber’s DRDO Advancing work on ALBM Programs.,https://idrw.org/with-buzz-around-strategic-bombers-drdo-advancing-work-on-albm-programs/,"August 15, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. Whether India is planning to procure Russian Tu-160 Strategic bomber’s on lease to be used as Nuclear payload delivery mechanism to enhance its nuclear deterrence is still up for debate and mystery will remain until IAF officially comments about it but that has not stopped DRDO from working on the development of Air-launched ballistic missile or ALBM programs for IAF. DRDO is reportedly working on two versions of the ALBM, one being a shorter version with a range of 500-700km and another with a range over 1500km. At this point, it is not clear if it can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads but since it will be classified as a strategic weapon it will be limited to Su-30MKI for launching this missile. ALBMs have advantages over Air launched Cruise missiles when it comes to better target-penetration than slow-moving sub-sonic cruise missiles along with maneuvering capabilities so that they can be used to take out highly defended command centers or weapons depots located deep inside the enemy territory. ALBMs with their kinetic energy and with huge warheads are perfectly capable of decimating any targets on the ground and are much cheaper than hypersonic cruise missiles. The basic concept of the ALBMs was to allow Indian jets to launch their weapons from well outside the range of enemy air defenses."

Former Air chief stressed that it is important that India finds more customers for LCA Mk1, Mk2, and AMCA so that Private Indian players that have chosen to join this program can not only increase their business but also not be dependent on one customer alone for orders. Raha also said that it is important that the first production line for India’s 5th generation AMCA program is up and running by 2030 that is created by the state-owned HAL and the second production line is ready by 2032 created by the Public-Private sector consortium to develop an advanced version of AMCA called Mk2. Several countries have shown interest in Indian-developed LCA-Tejas Mk1 aircraft and it is important to convert this interest into firm orders said Raha. HAL recently in its annual report confirmed that It has offered LCA-Trainer/LIFT aircraft to Egypt, Australia, and Naval LIFT to the United States of America and single-seater Tejas Mk1A to Argentina, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia."

The Philippines has officially canceled the contract to purchase 16 Russian military transport helicopters for the Philippine air force due to fears of U.S. sanctions amid the Russia-Ukraine war. Without the Mi-17s, the Philippines would be left with an outstanding requirement for heavy transport helicopters. Philippine military officials have confirmed that several Western transport helicopter types have been offered but there are way too expensive for them. The Philippine military is looking at India’s offer of ALH-Dhruv which doesn’t have similar payload capabilities as Mi-17s but its price was a draw for the Philippines.

Indian specific version won’t be merely Indian additional weapons but also the addition of Indian electronic warfare system but also deep access to the avionics modifications including its present software suite that will allow India to upgrade systems and weapons without the need for American permission. Publications claim that India will be supplied F-35 in a complete knock-down (CKD) and will get country-specific modifications and enhancements by the selected local partner of Lockheed Martin in India before it is delivered to India. In 2021, Lockheed delivered 142 F-35s and is ramping up production to hit a max of 156 jets a year by 2023. Lockheed Martin is trying to hit a base unit cost of $77 Million for F-35A that will make it cheaper than many of the 4.5Gen fighters that are offered to India under MRFA tender for 114 jets but F-35A still has unusually high operating per hour costs that will make Indian Air Force wary of F-35A. Indian ADA along with HAL already has started manufacturing components for the prototype of India’s 5.5gen AMCA fighter jet that it plans to roll out by 2024 and conclude its first flight by 2025 and enter production by 2030.

"Sanctioned Western chips and electronics may still find a way to Russia, says think tank",https://idrw.org/sanctioned-western-chips-and-electronics-may-still-find-a-way-to-russia-says-think-tank/,"August 12, 2022","SOURCE: GIRISH LINGANNA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG. According to a recent RUSI think tank analysis, hundreds of foreign-made microelectronic components, such as processors, were detected in Russian weapons used in its invasion of Ukraine. The report, titled ‘Silicon Lifeline: Western Electronics at the Heart of Russia’s War Machine,’ includes an examination of the components and operation of 27 of Russia’s most modern’ weapons, including cruise missiles, and discovered at least 450 foreign-made components, many of which were manufactured by US companies known for providing microelectronics to the US military. According to the 8 August study, as many as 80 components were subject to US export prohibitions, which RUSI argued showed Russia’s military-industrial complex had effectively avoided. RUSI noted that the technical inspection of Russian equipment captured in or fired at Ukraine outlined how Russia’s military modernisation programme has depended on US, Japanese, Taiwanese, South Korean, Swiss, Dutch, British, French, and German-manufactured microelectronics. According to the article, to be authorised to utilise foreign components in military equipment, Russian enterprises must demonstrate to the Russian Ministry of Defence that there is no local alternative. Russia has lost massive quantities of equipment and severely reduced its supplies of cruise and ballistic missiles since the beginning of the invasion. According to RUSI Open Source Intelligence and Analysis (OSIA) research scholar Gary Somerville, one of the report’s authors, given the tonnage of Russian weaponry wasted or lost on Ukraine, Moscow will have to decide how it would replace them. Since the evidence so far suggests that they are highly reliant on components produced by companies in West and East Asia, it strongly indicates that Russia does not have the domestic microchip manufacturing industry to readily replace the microchips at the volumes and level of sophistication that it requires to rebuild its stockpiles of military equipment, Somerville explains. This is especially true for vital components seized from many Russian missiles, which rely on sophisticated US-made microchips in their computer and processing units to swiftly interpret data received from the missile’s different sensors. The paper covers numerous such systems, breaking down the microelectronics contained within them, such as the Tornado-S missile system, which incorporates field programmable gate arrays, static RAM chips, and flash memory modules manufactured in the West. Western components are also used in a number of systems, including the Orlan-10 UAV, the Akveduk radio station, and the 9M549 Glonass guided missile. The great bulk of the components mentioned in the reports may be traced back to the United States. Russian Kalibr cruise missiles contain Ethernet transceivers, static RAM, and other Western components. Iskander-K cruise missiles have Western microelectronics as well. Sanctions and tighter export controls have been imposed to deter Russia’s military-industrial complex and cut off Moscow’s access to dual-use components. ‘Following the imposition of fresh sanctions and tougher export controls, the Russian government has sought to address the severance of access to vital components through import substitution,’ RUSI wrote in its study. This strategy was later discovered to be unworkable. As a result, Russia must either develop new, less capable weapons or engage in sanctions evasion, which has become a vital priority for its special forces. According to Somerville, one of the difficulties in cutting off the flow of Western electronics is that many microchips and other components are subject to export regulations. He also said that many of the identified microchips and components are not subject to export limits, implying that they can be found in common microelectronics. Second, he stated that, according to RUSI research, the Russian military-industrial complex, as well as security and intelligence services, make significant use of front firms to conceal the end user. Furthermore, the Russians use third-country transhipment hubs such as Hong Kong, where resellers of microelectronics have acted as an intermediary for sending foreign-sourced microelectronics, most likely including those subject to export controls, onto Russian companies, which have then found their way into Russian weapons currently being used against Ukraine. The RUSI assessment stated that if ‘proper measures are followed,’ Russian military power may be permanently weakened. According to Somerville, governments, exporters, and manufacturers should take a variety of steps to limit the flow of these microelectronics to Russia.He stated that states should try to uncover and shut down Russia’s “covert procurement networks” abroad, as well as enhance current export controls. He also stated that microelectronics exporters should exercise increased due diligence to guarantee that components do not end up in the hands of a military end-user or military end-use. Third (party) nations and jurisdictions that are involved in re-exporting commodities to Russia and its military industry should also be given special consideration. Finally, Somerville stated that while Russia is still likely to buy the microelectronics and associated components that its military requires, these steps will greatly increase their prices in order for them to be even modestly effective in this endeavour. The RUSI assessment stated that “the moment to act is now,” as Russia scrambles to acquire in bulk before the net of western microelectronic supply shuts.Sanctioned Western chips and electronics may still find a way to Russia, says think tank According to a recent RUSI think tank analysis, hundreds of foreign-made microelectronic components, such as processors, were detected in Russian weapons used in its invasion of Ukraine.

India exploring the construction of Missile silos,https://idrw.org/india-exploring-the-construction-of-missile-silos/,"August 12, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. The most significant expansion of the Indian nuclear arsenal ever might be in the pipelines that if approved will see the construction of silo-based ICBMs in hidden mountain terrain that will enhance India’s second nuclear strike significantly. Silo-based ICBMs are deployed fully ready and capable of launching on short notice, unlike their Mobile counterparts which require time and are also vulnerable to attacks in the first wave. According to experts, the No First Use policy means it has a secure second-strike capability to retaliate against a nuclear first strike on its soil, and a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine program will play a crucial role in ensuring that India has second strike option but the mobile ballistic missile launch systems are vulnerable that will limit India’s nuclear and conventional response if attacked first. Although India formally remains committed to its posture of “minimum” nuclear deterrence, it is also responding to the competitive relationship with countries’ adversaries to keep its force survivable and capable of holding adversarial targets at risk. Silo-based ICBMs will come as a bolster to its second-strike capability."

On this date that year, on 10 August 1999, Pakistani Naval aircraft, Flight Atlantic-91, a French-built Breguet Atlantic plane was shot down after it entered Indian airspace just a month after the Kargil conflict had ceased. With tensions still running high, IAF ground radars picked up what was positively identified as French-built Atlantique with the Pakistan Navy when it breached the International border which was quickly followed up by a scramble of Two Mig-21 from the Naliya base of IAF. Squadron Leader Prashant Bundela flying the lead Mig-21 visually identified that Pakistani Navy aircraft and radioed the pilot to follow him to the nearest airbase but the pilot decided to carry out hostile maneuvers to shake off the pair of Mig-21 and make a run back towards the International border. Aircraft was immediately declared hostile and R-60 a short-range lightweight infrared homing air-to-air missile was fired that hit the Atlantique’s left engine. On August 11, 1999, three IAF Mi-8 transport helicopters with 50 international journalists in total on board this helicopters had taken off from Naliya Air Force base in Gujarat and were flying towards the Sir Creek region in the Rann of Kutch to spot the wreckage of a French-built Atlantique maritime reconnaissance aircraft but Pakistani forces fired Swedish RBS-70 surface-to-air missile at our helicopter, Mi-8 helicopter dived down and managed to save its self from the missile. What followed for the next 10 days was a hostile combat air patrol by the Pakistani Air Force that was responded well by the Indian Air Force, PAF was looking for revenge and was trying hard to create provocation by breaching the 10km safe zone that each country had agreed to maintain to avoid any airspace violations. IAF deployed Mig-29 and Su-30K (Predecessor of Su-30MKI) with Mig-21 as a backup to counter Pakistan’s deployment of F-16s in the area. PAF was flying aggressive combat sorties near the border and was looking to ambush Indian jet across the border by trying to draw IAF aircraft near the International border. PAF jets frequently came 4-5km away from the border to provoke often by a pair of F-16s with more giving cover at higher altitudes but the BVR advantage that IAF had prevented them from trying to cross the border and intense flying started taking its toll on the 40 odd F-16s that PAF had back then when it was already under US sanctions with the supply of spares interrupted."

Tu-160 could carry enough fuel to fly 12070km with a 50% missile payload, and its retractable refueling probe enabled even greater ranges if desired will give India enough muscle if it ever wants to flex it but this should be seen as an interim solution because Tu-160 can fly at Mach 2 but still has huge radar cross section that is will make it nearly impossible to penetrate contested airspace but the ability to launch long-range ALBM into enemy airspace while staying deep inside on air space is a privilege that knows one will let go once you have tasted it and it should be taken to build a case for the development of stealth Medium-Range Stealth Bomber of Indian origin.

P-75I: Will German comeback boost Indian Navy’s Tender?,https://idrw.org/p-75i-will-german-comeback-boost-indian-navys-tender/,"August 8, 2022","SOURCE: RAJESH AHUJA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG German shipbuilder ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) had withdrawn from the Indian Navy’s tender for the construction of six diesel-electric submarines due to stringent rules regarding liabilities laws in the contract might be making a come back after India withdrew some of the liabilities clauses that could have made foreign company responsible for the job done by its strategic partner in the country. India already has extended the bid date by another six months after only Korean and Spanish shipyard offered their submarine design to meet the Indian Navy’s requirements for six next-generation submarines, this one change might now clear the way for the Germans to come back in the race but it will not be easy for Russians and French shipbuilders since Navy is still adamant that only ships with proven Air-independent propulsion (AIP) system will meet technical criteria. Indian Navy is looking to procure ships with surface displacement that is close to 3000T to be equipped with proven Air-independent propulsion (AIP) system and Vertical Launch System (VLS) for sub-sonic and supersonic cruise missiles that could ensure submarine length will increase by 30-35% when compared to Kalvari-class submarines that are still being inducted by the Indian Navy. TKMS developed Type-212CD that are based on Type 212A submarine design with a surface displacement of 2500T and is likely will be offered to the Indian Navy as well. It is not clear if the Navy will be ready to compromise on its actual displacement or will insist it meet 3000T requirements. Germans in the previous Project-75 tender had offered its original Type 212A submarine design to India that lost out to the French-Spanish Kalvari-class submarine.

Indian Air Force will soon arm its Russian-developed Su-30MKI fighter jet squadrons with a deadly long-range derivate of the Israeli Derby BVR Air-to-Air Missile with Active Radar seeker as its captive flight trial near completion. I-Derby ER powered by a dual-pulse rocket motor can engage aerial targets in a range exceeding 100Km (140km ). I-Derby ER contains electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) designed to deal with the challenges of aerial combat in a hostile environment with exceptional operational flexibility and already has been cleared for operations on India’s LCA-Tejas Mk1 Platform. After Astra Mk1 (110km) BVR integration, I-Derby ER will further boost Su-30s Air to Air missile arsenal. IAF has planned to slowly phase out Russian-developed R-77 BVR missiles for better Astra Mk1 and I-Derby ER BVR missiles that can engage targets over 100km and feature two-way communication based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) system that is very difficult to jam. IAF also has plans to integrate Astra Mk2 (160km) and Astra Mk3 (340km) with Very Long range air to air missiles by 2025. Trials of the Israeli I-Derby ER BVRAAMs along with Astra Mk2 are planned to be carried out this year and through 2023 to certify before they are cleared for operations."
2035: Why IAF will never reach its 42 Squadron Strength,https://idrw.org/2035-why-iaf-will-never-reach-its-42-squadron-strength/,"August 8, 2022","SOURCE: NARAYAN APTE/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG It Amazes me that the top brass of the Indian Air Force confirm to the national media that even 13 years in the future, IAF will be no way near its sanctioned 42 squadron strength. With the current pace of induction and retirements, the Indian Air Force can only get a maximum of 35 squadrons in the next 10 years, up from the current 31-32. IAF as per its assessment had called the need for having 42 squadrons to protect the western and northern borders with Pakistan and China. Even to achieve 35 Squadrons by 2035, IAF will need to induct 83 Light Combat aircraft MK1A, 114 MRFA, 106 Tejas Mk2, and at least 40 Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft. Any deviation from these plans means IAF will be short by another 4-5 Squadrons which will mean 200 combat jets less in inventory and what’s scarier is that IAF Top brass doesn’t seem to mind having such levels of squadrons to face possible two-front war scenario. Chinese PLAAF has been inducting nearly 90 4.5 and 5th gen fighter jets annually and has been replacing its older F-7, and F-8 based on 60 techs much faster than what IAF has been able to manage. China already has two 5th gen programs and 3rd is for future aircraft carriers in development with rumors also of a STOVL variant in pipelines. By 2035, PLAAF will have at least 90% of the jets that are from 4.5Gen and 5gen based and most likely all newly built ones and might see 6th gen fighter jets also. PAF on the other side has been steadying inducting 4.5 gen JF-17 fighter jets even though they are a lot of questions regarding its build quality and operational capabilities but a steady intake of 20+ jets each year has come as a sigh of relief to the older Mirage-III jets that strangely PAF prefers for ground strikes more then JF-17s. But recent quick induction of J-10CE also shows that China can beef up PAF in a much shorter time with supplies even in case of one front war with India, a luxury that IAF won’t have. India’s national security lies in how fast it can procure 114 jets from abroad since this is what IAF wants and this is the only way IAF thinks it can address the elephant in the room that is the lack of fighter jets. For years now IAF has overlooked the LCA-Tejas program only to wake up in 2021 to give it further orders, it ignored the Mk2 program for a while until it was forced to commit orders for its, AMCA is still a long way to go and anything can happen that can derail or delay the program that needs to be watched out for but roadmap that IAF has prepared till 2040 and beyond is nothing impressive to show growing regional power of the country that wants to be top 3 economic in this period."
AMCA: IWT Model shows some of the Design characteristics of India’s 5th Gen jet,https://idrw.org/amca-iwt-model-shows-some-of-the-design-characteristics-of-indias-5th-gen-jet/,"August 7, 2022","SOURCE: IDRW NEWS NETWORK The integrated wind tunnel model of the AMCA Mk1 shows some of the design characters that will be included at least in the Mk1 variant of the jet from the start. The scaled Model showcases a Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI) that will addition of the 3D bump will help in concealing engine blades from radar waves from bouncing back to their source, and serpentine air intake will further improve the stealth and design elements of the aircraft. AMCA sports an advanced Infrared search and track sensor (IRST) in the traditional position installed atop the aircraft’s nose, near its windscreen, there is chatter that the IRST system is retractable which will make it the first of its kind. Although the placement of the IRST sensor will hurt the radar signature on the forward fuselage section, it could be a stop-gap measure at least for the initial prototypes till DRDO can come up with its own Distributed Aperture System (DAS) style system in Mk1 or Mk2 variants of the jet. Some of the smaller things seen on the airframe like a turret mounted dorsally behind the cockpit can’t be verified at this point, but it seems it could be a Directional Infrared Counter Measure sensor that could be used to blind incoming IR missiles which usually follows rear engine heat. What seems to look like an APU intake unit on the midsection of the spine is a combined pre-cooler and heat exchanger, that will also have a brake chute that is part of the rear fuselage. AMCA will also feature a 23mm GSh-23 twin-barrel internal cannon on its left side just behind the cockpit section. AMCA will feature Internal Weapons Bay from the start that can carry 4 medium to long range air to air missiles internally or two medium range air to air missiles with two 500kg smart bombs in a stealth configuration. Above all else, the AMCA program will be incorporating innovative concepts like unmanned operational capabilities, Auto take-off, and auto landing features but rest assured low observable design will see further tech infusion to make it far more deadly when it enters service in 2031 onwards."

The Strategic Forces Command (SFC) is the only tri-service functional command that controls, manages, and administers the country’s nuclear weapons. idrw like to point out that SFC a few years back had suggested it be allowed to operate 40 Sukhoi-30MKI that will be in charge of delivering nuclear payloads independent of the Indian Air Force. SFC is dependent on the IAF’s fleet of fighter jets like Mirage-2000 and Su-30MKI to deliver nuclear payloads then IAF top brass was strongly against the creation of a such separate fleet. English Electric Canberra, was the only dedicated bomber type that the IAF operated until the late seventies. Canberra was later replaced by the induction of Deep ground strike combat jets like now retired Russian Mig-27 and Anglo-French Jaguar jets that will be retired by 2034. In the age of low observable bomber aircraft, IAF might be interested in procuring either the Russian PAK-DA next-generation stealth strategic bomber or American Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider to meet its requirements for SFC."

Why does India need Russian Zircon tech for BrahMos-2?,https://idrw.org/why-does-india-need-russian-zircon-tech-for-brahmos-2/,"August 6, 2022","SOURCE: JATIN RAM / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG India’s plans to develop a hypersonic cruise missile as a successor to the supersonic BrahMos is not new it has been in talks for the last decade or more and the first glimpses of the BrahMos-2 were first showcased way back in Aero India 2013 as a scaled model of what now looks very familiar to the Russian developed Zircon aka Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missiles when it was publically unveiled for the first time. Fast forward to 2022, BrahMos-2 is again in the news after CEO of the Russia-India Joint Venture BrahMos Aerospace Atul Rane told TASS, that BrahMos-2 would have some characteristics of the Russian-developed Tsirkon missile that seems to be the case for the transfer of technology for the scramjet engine that can take it to up to Mach 9 in speed but Indian variant or a downgraded scramjet engine might limit itself to just Mach 6 and its range limited to just 60%. DRDO under Project Visnu had planned to develop two long-range Hypersonic cruise missiles along with that it also had a separate Hypersonic glide missile program for a longer-range intercontinental range hypersonic missile. The BrahMos-2 concept remained a concept for over a decade now because Russians were not confident enough to share the technology with India at first since it wanted to be part of the elite Hypersonic missile control list that the US, China, and Russia wanted to create to dominate this market and limit reach of this technology but now it seems it’s out of the window due to sanctions on Russia from United states and realignment of the Russia and China that in next few years will ensure that Hypersonic cruise missile will be sold just like today’s sub-sonic cruise missile to the highest bidder. Going for Russian assistance in the development of BrahMos-2 will share most of the downgraded technology of the Russian Tsirkon missile system, Either Indian military planners are not showing much confidence in its Hypersonic programs or are not sure it will be ready in the next decade or so to reach production levels. Both DRDO and BrahMos have promised that India will have workable Hypersonic cruise missiles in the next 5-6 years, it will be interesting to see if DRDO can mature its hypersonic cruise missile technology first or we will again run to Russia to buy downgraded scramjets propulsion for the BrahMos-2."

Japanese think tank close to Japan self-defense force is of opinion that Indian Air Force might be forced to go for a Government to Government deal for the purchase of 5th generation fighter jets like F-35 if Chinese manages to supply its 5th gen J-31 from 2025 onwards. While India is developing its 5th generation fighter jet that will be in the same class as F-35, the paper opinioned that it won’t be ready for at least for next 15 years or more while PAF already has plans to procure J-31 fighter jets from China to replace its aging F-16 fleet and might be looking at local assemble of this jets after the JF-17 production line is closed some time in 2026-27. Paper also mentioned how to counter India’s purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France, China swung in and quickly countered by supplying Chinese developed J-10CE “Dragon” multi-role fighter aircraft to Pakistan in just 18 months. Pakistan is closely working with China to induct more lightweight JF-17 Block-III jets and also has started work on the Block-IV that will come with various upgrades and improvements. PAF sees 250 JF-17s as low-tier aircraft that will be backed by medium-weight J-10CE with the top tier being 5th gen fighter jets like J-31. PAF plans to retire Mirage-III/V and Chinese F-7 fleet by 2030 and older F-16 MLU-15 by 2035. PAF has procured 25 J-10CE in the first batch and 25 more will likely be procured sometime soon. Pakistan’s plans to develop a 5th generation fighter jet locally have been scrapped and it is actively looking at the Chinese J-31 and Turkeys TFX program. US administration has started the process to add India as the sixth country in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) plus which would move New Delhi toward a Defense Security alignment with the United States. India will join a group of countries like Australia, Japan New Zealand, Israel, and South Korea that are the first to get access to cutting-edge weapons and armaments much before its given to the other 24 countries that are part of NATO."

AMCA to feature front opening canopy configuration like F-35,https://idrw.org/amca-to-feature-front-opening-canopy-configuration-like-f-35/,"July 28, 2022","SOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG. A sneak peek of digital renders provided by the ADA to ” India Tv ” for the first time confirms that India’s 5+ Gen fighter jet will also feature a front opening canopy windshield instead of the side opening canopy windshield seen on the Tejas Mk1A program. Traditionally fighter jets over from last few decades have adopted a rear opening canopy as standard fitment and some jets with a side opening canopy (LCA, Rafale) do exist but the least preferred ones are the front opening canopy until it was again seen in F-35 and now in Chinese deck-based J-35 5th generation fighter jets. F-35’s front opening canopy configuration design is largely attributed to the common design that was required to be carried on all three variants that were to be developed. F-35B, that’s the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL)-capable variant needs to accommodate a lift fan just behind the canopy and other elements to operate the aircraft as a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) due to which rear opening canopy design was not adopted and it is possible that in the future China might bring in a new deck based variant that features a STOVL variant of the J-35 that is based on the J-31 which features a rear opening canopy. The ADA’s decision to go with this canopy design will rise curiosity given that the biggest complaints of F-35 pilots always have been that the front opening canopy eliminates rearward visibility and not being able to physically look over your shoulder doesn’t help grasp situational awareness. AMCA canopy-cockpit arrangement might be for two reasons since at this point only ADA can clarify to get exact reasons. The foremost reasons could be to have easy access to the instrumentation and other electronic devices that are stored in the front fuselage and to reduce frequent usage of the access panels on the side. As seen in the above images, Acess pannel on the AMCA are not placed conveniently at multiple locations as seen in non-stealth fighter jets and it could be more to do with protecting Radar-absorbing material (RAM) stealth coating skin around the frontal section so as not to compromise stealth due to frequent opening on panels. The second reason could be that the central area of the fuselage is being used for storage of additional fuel in the aircraft and due to this front opening canopy configuration was found much more suitable. this configuration also has some aerodynamic advantages which are that the aircraft’s low-observable capabilities might be enhanced."

The above image highlights some of these features. Integrated boarding ladder: first seen on F-15 and later carried also on F-35, integral ladders allow the fleet to operate out of forward or dispersed airfields with limited logistical support. AMCA will feature it that confirms that IAF wants to operate them from a forward airbase where it’s not based to keep logistics support minimum. Laser designator pod (LDP): LDP seen on air-intake pylon confirms that AMCA won’t be coming with an Electro-Optical Targeting System type system from the very start and will feature such a system at later stages most likely in Mk2. Fixed or Retractable refueling probe: What seems to be a fixed or semi Retractable refueling probe on the aircraft and not a fully integrated one. IRST: Infrared search and track (IRST) system just above the nose near the cockpit confirms that at least the prototype will not feature DAS (Distributed Aperture System) EODAS sensor to provide threat detection and 360-degree situational awareness to the pilot. Front opening canopy configuration: After F-35, and J-35, AMCA will be the third 5th generation fighter jet that will feature Front opening canopy configuration, In this report, it has been explained in detail possible reasons why it was adopted."

An extended long-range rocket launch system that is deployed near LOC will mean that it could hit any Indian military base along the Line of Actual Control from deep inside of its controlled territory. Chinese Artillery brigade in the Western Theatre Command is currently equipped with PCL191 while the Indian Army multiple launch rocket system that is deployed both Russian and Indian made does not have the range to match this in performance and no data is available in public that claims that development of long-range multiple launch rocket system is underway in India. Prahaar and Pralay are Indian-developed, canisterised tactical, surface-to-surface, and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) that have a range from 150 to 500km. Prahaar a road-mobile tactical ballistic missile was last tested in 2018 but some media reports claim that Army was not happy about its limited range of 150km and wanted something with increased range. Pralay the bigger of the two has a range to hit targets as deep as 500km and was last tested in 2021 but it is highly unlikely that it has entered production since it is yet to conclude developmental trials. For some time it was rumored that DRDO was developing Pinaka MkIII which has a range of 150km but since DRDO has officially never acknowledged any such program in the public domain and most of the details are grainy its no clear if the project is active or not. The development of a long-range multiple rocket launcher system is not clear in the country even though the knowledge of the Chinese developing such a system for a while now was well known to Indian military bosses.

Usually, a military Gyrocopter is used by the Special Forces Operations for deploying soldiers behind the enemy line. This military Gyrocopter has been specially designed for high-altitude operations and has a claimed range of 690 kilometers and can touch a ceiling of 5,300 meters with a takeoff weight of 560 kilograms. Hunting Eagle gyrocopter can operate in temperatures as low as minus 36 C and recent images can be seen with two light air to surface antiarmor missiles that are usually seen on the smaller UAVs. Chinese OSNIT members claim that the small dimensions and low-flying ability keep it from being detected easily and are much better than helicopter insertion to carry out military operations behind the enemy lines. Some claim it was developed for low-level insertion into the island of Taiwan which lies barely 160km away from mainland China. Manufacturers of the Hunting Eagle gyrocopter claim that it can also glide for complete noise-less insertion if the engine power is cut out for a few minutes in the flight and can also operate at night with the help of night vision devices. The program began as a platform that can be used by Government agencies for traffic observation duties, and search and rescue coordination but the first military variant was developed in 2016 and since then many changes have been made so that it can operate even in hostile terrains like seen near Line of control. While the mainstream Indian defense analysts have not picked up on it but the reaction of the Indian OSNIT community had a hilarious take on its utility and how Chinese forces could be sitting ducks. But small section did make some wonder if due to low flying capabilities and very less radar cross section if forward radars may or may not be able to pick them up in time. since this is being used primarily by Chinese special forces they might have carried out validation of many tactics which they might use for successful operations."

Xi is not a popular man anymore in China with intention of pressing for a third term he already has rattled many insiders of his party creating fractions within who are working against him and the interest of China. The only wild card that Xi might want to test to unite China and also ensure he continued to remain in power is to win a swift war in the region that could make him popular again. The Chinese economy is under stress and Xi’s Zero covid policy is ensuring more lockdowns and restrictions that are further creating stress points for the economy. Xi needs a diversion and he might be tempted to show aggression in the region by trying to win a war to deflect from its issue at home and a pendulum sword is on top of both Taiwan and India for the last few months with no clear indication where it will fall. War with Taiwan seems easy but it might result in a full-scale intervention of the western military powers which the Chinese do not want but Chinese calculation could go wrong if Taiwan puts up resistance like Ukraine even without the military intervention of the west. Chinese forces have been training for swift war to take over Taiwan but if the Chinese have learned anything from the war in Ukraine, overwhelming conventional power simply doesn’t guarantee a swift win, and war might rage on for months and might backfire on Xi and his supporters. Galwan incident might have been a test case for the Xi but since then Indian military has been able to match troops to troops in numbers and also has speeded up its deployment and procurement of weapons in anticipation of the war. A short war with India without taking any areas might be possible in near future but it might result in a full-fledged war which the Chinese might not want since it can prolong the duration of the war. President Xi in his lust for power already has derailed Chinese economic growth, which has already seen some unrest, with his badly timed policies like a war in the region where Chinese is the aggressor will only fast track the downward trend of its economy but the upward trend of the Chinese economy growth recorded for the last 30+ years has kept enough in the coffers that can keep them steady for next 25-30 years even if Xi remains in power for next 10 years but any misadventure now might shorten that steadiness by 10-15 years for the Chinese economy."
West Backed KAI KF-21 is impressive but don’t ridicule Tejas MkII and AMCA program,https://idrw.org/west-backed-kai-kf-21-is-impressive-but-dont-ridicule-tejas-mkii-and-amca-program/,"July 22, 2022","SOURCE: RAJESH AHUJA / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG South Korea’s indigenously developed KF-21 ‘Boramae’ recently concluded its first flight which was impressive in many ways since this was done as per the schedule and flat in 7 years since the program was announced. South Korea’s Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) being a close and significant partner with the US military and defense industry has benefitted a lot from these tie-ups which is one of the main reasons why they managed to pull this off. KAI’s KF-21 program is backed by American giant Lockheed Martin which is providing several components to design consultancy for the program. The list of components and systems that were supplied to the KF-21 program involves everything from brake pads, flight controls systems, LRUs, landing gear, avionics, canopy, oxygen generator, Radar, engine, ejection seats, and even the software management system of the aircraft and it is a staggering list of imported systems plus numerous industrial grade tools and consultancy to fall back to for technical developments. KAI says by the time KF-21 Block III is out which is touted to be a true stealth fighter variant by 2035, KAI might have indigenized most of the systems locally but till then it’s just a 4.5gen fighter jet with elements of 5th generation fighter which is still in making. But the fact remains that it has 20 out of 24 main subsystems of US origin and 1 of Israeli origin and the program is heavily backed by American defense industrial partners the best money can buy. When compared to India’s Tejas Mk1 program, Indigenous content of the Mk1 is 59.7 percent by value and 75.5 percent by number with MkII Indigenous content will have more than 70 percent by value with the engine making up for 30 percent but by number, it might cross 85 percent when it enters production. Many of the main subsystems will be of Indian origin with only Ejection seats and engines of foreign origin which interestingly will also be replaced after entering service with Indian-made ones further driving Indigenous content. AMCA program for India is a whole new different ball game where next-generation technology in development for the program is much more intense than for other programs but it also will see many systems and sub-systems that might be a world first and with each fighter jet program Indian scientist and engineers are growing with the confidence of having import free fighter jet systems in the newer jet and drive up Indigenous content.

Armed force might be addicted to imported weapons but Modi Government is stuck in Redtape,https://idrw.org/armed-force-might-be-addicted-to-imported-weapons-but-modi-government-is-stuck-in-redtape/,"July 21, 2022","SOURCE: SATYAJEET KUMAR/ FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG Was surprised to see PM Modi going all guns blazing in taking out a dig at the Indian Armed forces for not reducing the weapons import bill and supporting locally developed weapons systems in the country. In the last few years of the Government lot of things have happened due to which there is a rise in Indian private sector participation in the segment that was dominated by the State-owned public sector companies for the last 60 years in the country but Modi himself has been sitting on many key projects that are yet to see the day of light which could have boosted Indian arms industry further. Indian Armed forces due to tensions with China have managed to procure many of the imported weapons through emergency routes that came as a setback to many local alternative products that we’re dying for orders. The so-called negative list created by the Government also doesn’t have big-ticket items that could help reduce import weapons bills but rather smaller systems and components that do not cost much. Indian Army’s Artillery modernization plans have been in limbo for a while now and yet every now n then we see reports that the Army wants clearance to procure Israeli guns under the same emergency purchases even though the country has developed 3-4 Artillery guns of different calibers of late which are a match if not superior to import alternatives. Token orders for Arjun main battle tank even after the not-so-impressive performance of the T-90 and T-72 tanks in the Ukraine war should have opened more orders for the locally developed Arjun tanks but that will make way for a new next-generation tank program that might go around for another 20 years. Tejas MkII program has been touch and go for a while now since the air force is much more interested in ensuring that procurement of 114 jets from abroad is not hampered. Official funds for the AMCA program is yet to come so are funds for the development of a new engine for the program. The last few years’ major big ticket items cleared by the government for the air force have been the purchase of 36 Rafale jets and the C295 tactical airlifter deal both awarded to foreign companies with HAL bagging orders for 83 Tejas Mk1A that it will take nearly another 3 years to mature. The Navy has struggled to procure more submarines as an endless loop of delays and deadlines continues. The same government also has not cleared the way for its acquire the third aircraft carrier that it always wanted. The only positive for the Navy has been that it got clearance for the development of nuclear attack submarines but the funds clearance might take even more time as seen with all projects. Tri-service has massive requirements for nearly 400 light helicopters to replace aging French utility choppers that have an average age of 35-40 years now but still, there is no urgency seen to place orders for the LUH that has cleared most of the basic requirements set by the government as it waits for orders to start production. LCH is also another helicopter program that is yet to take off due to a lack of firm orders from the service and grant of funds from the government for its procurement. Private sector companies are inching to break into the unmanned aerial systems market in the country but public sector companies are not letting them come in. India’s product portfolio when it comes to homemade unmanned aerial systems is not only poor but we are even behind Pakistan and Iran which have developed a host of armed and unarmed unmanned aerial systems in the last couple of years. Armed forces will try to secure more weapons from import routes due to the massive lobby that still prevails in the system. Government should stop giving exemptions from the negative list it has created and start adding more items to the negative lists especially big-ticket items like fighter jets, engines, submarines, and marine engines so that the Indian military is not affected by economic sanctions put on countries that have been traditional weapons suppliers of India.

LCA Mk2: Its time GOI grants Funds for the program,https://idrw.org/lca-mk2-its-time-goi-grants-funds-for-the-program/,"July 19, 2022","SOURCE: JATIN RAM / FOR MY TAKE / IDRW.ORG After months of suspense and the recent uproar over the non-committal attitude of the Indian Air Force and clarification that nearly six squadrons which translate into 108 jets will be procured and further orders might be looked at in the future finally clears the mist that has been building over the program for a while now. In 2018, IAF was considering acquiring 12 squadrons (216) of LCA Mk2 but that in 2022 is almost half with official funding for the program yet to be granted. HAL has started work on the assembly of the first LCA Mk2 that came from the FSED phase 2/3 funds that were originally marked for F-414 engine-equipped Tejas Mk1 airframe, a program that started as a re-engine program as translated into a full-fledged program for a medium class fighter jet that has evolved from 2017 onwards even till 2020. HAL requires funds for the development of 3 more LCA Mk2 jets that are marked to be used for developmental and weapons trials and funds for the same must be allocated so as not to affect the program or cause any delays. AMCA program might not be officially received funds yet but at least it had received seed money for the design and development of the program, unlike the LCA Mk2 program that never happened and whatever money that was left from the LCA Mk1 program. IAF has committed to procure 7 squadrons of AMCA jets and it will be interesting to see if orders will see a rise but restricting LCA Mk2 orders to just 7 squadrons seems to be a calculated move to give the AMCA program a chance and also to see if additional squadrons can be accommodated instead of the LCA Mk2 jets but it will be near impossible to match LCA Mk2 and AMCA in terms of procurement and operational cost and at best IAF will have funds only for 1-2 additional AMCA Squadrons that still gives chances for additional orders for the LCA Mk2. LCA Mk2 is very important to fill the gap that will be left by the Mirage-2000 and Mig-29 fleet from 2030 onwards and funds for the program must be given to the developers so that it can be developed at right time and can make or break the IAF’s modernization plans."

Multirotor drones due to stronger wind conditions in high altitudes rarely operate over 10,000 ft mainly because air is increasingly thinner the higher you go, and there’s less and less force that can maintain its weight in the air (pushing against the propeller blades). Certain experimental multirotor drones have demonstrated flights to an altitude of 33.000ft but never sustained range in this for long and were done on purpose only to achieve records. Consumer drones are allowed to fly up to 400ft to keep them away from incoming planes or helicopters. Many Consumer drones have software limitation that limits flight at a certain height for safety reasons. multirotor drones adopted for High-altitude operations will be seen as a boost for the Indian military operations in areas close to the Line of Control (LOC) and Line of Actual Control (LAC)."
